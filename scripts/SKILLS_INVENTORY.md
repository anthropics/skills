### Model Readme Content
```markdown
1. [Description]
This skill enables the creation of algorithmic art using p5.js. It follows a two-step process: first defining an "Algorithmic Philosophy" (a manifesto of the aesthetic movement), and then expressing that philosophy through code (HTML/JS). It emphasizes seeded randomness, emergent behavior, and computational beauty.

2. [requirements]
- Ability to generate Markdown (.md) for the philosophy.
- Ability to generate HTML and JavaScript (.js) for the p5.js sketch.
- p5.js library (usually loaded via CDN in the generated HTML).

3. [Cautions]
- Do not copy existing artists' work; focus on original algorithmic concepts.
- Ensure the generated HTML correctly references the p5.js library.
- The philosophy step is critical; do not skip it to just write code.
- The code should be 90% algorithmic generation and 10% parameters.

4. [Definitions]
- **Algorithmic Philosophy**: A written manifesto defining the aesthetic movement, rules, and behaviors of the art to be created.
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creative coding.
- **Seeded Randomness**: Using a fixed seed to ensure reproducible but random-looking results.

5. [log]
(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)

6. [model_readme]
To use this skill:
1. **Phase 1**: Generate an Algorithmic Philosophy based on user input. Output this as a Markdown file.
   - Name the movement.
   - Articulate the philosophy (form, process, behavior).
   - Emphasize craftsmanship.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the philosophy in p5.js.
   - Create an HTML file that loads p5.js.
   - Create a JS file with the sketch code.
   - Ensure the code reflects the philosophy defined in Phase 1.

**Helper Script**:
You can use `python skills/algorithmic-art/scripts/scaffold_art.py --name "ProjectName"` to create the folder structure and empty files in the OUTBOX.

1. [Description]
This skill generates a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals compliant cover page. It uses a Python script to populate a DOCX template with case-specific information such as the case number, filing title, and judge's name. It is designed to ensure formatting compliance for appellate briefs and motions.

2. [requirements]

- `python-docx` library
- A valid DOCX template (internal to the script or provided path)
- Access to `d:\Nineth Circuit\CLAUDE_COPILOT HLP\NINTH CIR5\COVER_GENERATOR_COMPLETE\generate_cover.py` (Note: The script location is external to the skill folder in the current configuration, see SKILL.md).

3. [Cautions]
- Ensure the Case Number is in the correct format (e.g., 25-6461).
- The script path is hardcoded in the SKILL.md examples; verify the path exists before running.
- The output directory `COVER_GENERATOR_COMPLETE/output/` must exist or be writable.
- Verify the judge's name spelling as it appears on the District Court docket.

4. [Definitions]
- **Case Number**: The appellate case number assigned by the Ninth Circuit (not the District Court number).
- **Filing Name**: The exact title of the document being filed (e.g., "APPELLANT'S OPENING BRIEF").
- **Judge Name**: The name of the District Court judge whose decision is being appealed.

5. [log]
(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)

6. [model_readme]
To use this skill, execute the python script `generate_cover.py` with the required arguments.
Command format:
`python "d:\Nineth Circuit\CLAUDE_COPILOT HLP\NINTH CIR5\COVER_GENERATOR_COMPLETE\generate_cover.py" --case "[CASE_NUMBER]" --filing "[FILING_NAME]" --judge "[JUDGE_NAME]"`

Example:
`python "d:\Nineth Circuit\CLAUDE_COPILOT HLP\NINTH CIR5\COVER_GENERATOR_COMPLETE\generate_cover.py" --case "25-6461" --filing "APPELLANT'S OPENING BRIEF" --judge "Stacy Beckerman"`

## slack-gif-creator
**Directory**: `slack-gif-creator`
**Description**: Toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack, with validators for size constraints and composable animation primitives. This skill applies when users request animated GIFs or emoji animations for Slack from descriptions like "make me a GIF for Slack of X doing Y".

### Model Readme Content
```markdown
1. [Description]
This skill provides a toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack. It includes validators for Slack's strict size/dimension constraints and composable primitives for creating animations (shake, bounce, etc.). It is useful for creating custom emoji or reaction GIFs.

2. [requirements]
- Python environment with image processing capabilities (likely PIL/Pillow).
- Access to the validator scripts and animation primitives defined in the skill.
- Source images or text to animate.

3. [Cautions]
- **Strict Limits**: Slack Emoji GIFs must be < 64KB. This is very small.
- **Dimensions**: 128x128 for emojis, 480x480 for message GIFs.
- **Colors**: Limit palette to 32-48 colors for emojis to save space.

4. [Definitions]
- **Emoji GIF**: A small, square animated image used as a custom emoji.
- **Message GIF**: A larger animated image used in chat messages.
- **Validator**: A script that checks if the file meets Slack's technical requirements.

5. [log]
(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)

6. [model_readme]
To create a Slack GIF:
1. **Determine Type**: Emoji (<64KB) or Message (~2MB).
2. **Create**: Use animation primitives (code) to generate frames.
3. **Optimize**: Reduce colors, frames, and dimensions.
4. **Validate**: Run the validator script to ensure it meets Slack's limits.
5. **Iterate**: If validation fails, reduce quality/length and try again.

**Helper Script**:
Use `python skills/slack-gif-creator/scripts/create_gif.py --create-sample "output.gif"` to generate a sample or `--validate "output.gif"` to check compliance.

## universal-motion-brief

### Model Readme Content
```markdown
1. [Description]
This skill builds motions and appellate briefs by merging structured data (JSON) into a user-supplied DOCX template. It preserves the original template's formatting, styles, and footnotes, making it ideal for generating documents that require strict adherence to a specific layout or style guide without the risk of generative AI hallucinating formatting.

2. [requirements]
- Python 3.x
- `python-docx` library
- A `.docx` template file with `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`.
- A `.json` data file containing the values for the placeholders.

3. [Cautions]
- Placeholders must match exactly (case-sensitive).
- Do not place placeholders inside footnotes if you need to preserve them (the script may not process them correctly or might break the footnote reference).
- Ensure the JSON structure matches the expected placeholders.
- The script does not re-flow text; it only replaces tokens.

4. [Definitions]
- **Template**: A DOCX file containing static text and `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders.
- **Mapping**: An optional JSON file that maps keys in your data to the tokens in the template (e.g., `{"case_no": "CASE_NUMBER"}`).
- **Render**: The process of replacing placeholders with actual data.

5. [log]
(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)

6. [model_readme]
Use the `scripts/render_docx.py` script to generate the document.

Command format:
`python skills/universal-motion-brief/scripts/render_docx.py --template "[PATH_TO_TEMPLATE]" --data "[PATH_TO_DATA]" --output "[PATH_TO_OUTPUT]"`

Options:
- `--mapping [PATH]`: Use if your data keys don't match template tokens.
- `--strict`: Fail if any placeholder is left unfilled.

Example:
`python skills/universal-motion-brief/scripts/render_docx.py --template "templates/motion.docx" --data "data/motion_data.json" --output "OUTBOX/motion.docx"`

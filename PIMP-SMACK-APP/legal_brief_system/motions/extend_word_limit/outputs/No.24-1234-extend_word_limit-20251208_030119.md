UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

TYLER ALLEN LOFALL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. STATE OF OREGON, et al., Defendants-Appellees

No. 24-1234

APPELLANT'S MOTION TO EXCEED WORD LIMIT FOR OPENING BRIEF

<!-- Block: Introduction & Relief Summary -->
Pursuant to FRAP 27 and Ninth Cir. R. 27-1, Tyler Allen Lofall respectfully requests:
1. Leave to file the Opening Brief up to 20,000 words under FRAP 32(a)(7)(B) and Ninth Cir. R. 32-2
2. Acceptance of both the 13,000-word compliant brief and the full 20,000-word version submitted contemporaneously

Immediate relief is necessary because the opening brief must describe four interlocking proceedings and 2,200+ pages of record materials documenting systemic fraud; truncating to 13,000 words would omit essential authorities and facts.

<!-- Block: Factual Background -->
The appeal consolidates four coordinated proceedings: (1) the probate diversion of $111,943.56, (2) the state civil action, (3) the criminal prosecution ending in dismissal, and (4) the federal civil-rights action dismissed on September 3, 2025. ER-1-400
Two master case-law files (1,100 and 1,093 pages) document the fraud schemes and policy failures that must be summarized for the Court. App'x-CaseLaw-1100 / App'x-CaseLaw-1093
Appellant must discuss at least four controlling Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authorities (Lewis v. Casey, Christopher v. Harbury, City of Canton v. Harris, and Monell) in depth to show the breadth of the constitutional violations. ECF 45
Appellant is simultaneously submitting both the 13,000-word compliant brief and the complete 20,000-word brief so the Court can proceed even if this motion is denied. See Exs. 1-2

<!-- Block: Legal Standard -->
A party may exceed the standard word limit only upon a showing of extraordinary and compelling circumstances (FRAP 32(a)(7)(B)(iii); 9th Cir. R. 32-2).
- The motion must explain why the additional words are necessary despite diligent editing
- The movant must show the enlarged brief is essential to address the issues fairly
- The request must be tailored and no longer than needed

Authorities: FRAP 32(a)(7)(B), FRAP 27, Ninth Cir. R. 32-2, Circuit Advisory Committee Note to Rule 32-2

<!-- Block: Argument Section -->
I. The Combined Record and Authorities Cannot Be Fairly Presented Within 13,000 Words
The record spans four different dockets, twelve dispositive orders, and over 2,200 pages of exhibits. Each segment documents a distinct phase of the fraud—probate diversion, state civil obstruction, criminal retaliation, and federal dismissal—that must be described chronologically for the Court to grasp the systemic pattern. Compressing that narrative below 13,000 words would force the omission of pivotal facts (e.g., the October 8 personal representative deception and the jail evidence purge) and would leave the Court without the context necessary to evaluate the errors.

1 See ER-12, ER-45, ER-102 (describing March 6, 2025 arrest, selective reporting, and file deletions).

II. A Limited 7,000-Word Expansion Will Not Prejudice Appellees
Appellant has already prepared a 13,000-word compliant brief and will file it alongside the extended version. Granting leave simply allows the Court to review the fuller discussion if it agrees that the extraordinary record justifies the additional text. Appellees retain the standard 13,000-word allotment for their answer brief and can respond using the existing schedule. Providing both versions ensures no delay even if the Court denies this motion.

<!-- Block: Requested Relief & Conclusion -->
For these reasons, Tyler Allen Lofall asks the Court to grant the following relief:
- Leave to file the Opening Brief up to 20,000 words under FRAP 32(a)(7)(B) and Ninth Cir. R. 32-2
- Acceptance of both the 13,000-word compliant brief and the full 20,000-word version submitted contemporaneously

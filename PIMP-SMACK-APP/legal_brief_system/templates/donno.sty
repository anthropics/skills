INTRODUCTION 
[Formatting: Text should be double-spaced, left-justified, and with an indent 
at the beginning of each paragraph.  Quotations more than two lines long may be 
indented and single-spaced, and headings and footnotes may be single-spaced.  
Margins must be at least one inch on all four sides.  Page numbers may be placed 
in the margins, but no text may appear there]. 
[Font:  Either a proportionally spaced or a monospaced face may be used 
(acceptable examples include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Century 
Schoolbook).  A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type 
may be used in headings and captions.  A proportionally spaced face must be 14
point or larger, while a monospaced face may not contain more than 10 1⁄2 
characters per inch.  Do not use a smaller font for footnotes.] 
[Type Styles:  A brief must be set in a plain, roman style, although italics or 
boldface may be used (sparingly) for emphasis.  Case names must be italicized or 
underlined.] 
[Practice Tip:  Although neither the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 
nor the Ninth Circuit Rules require an introduction, both allow one, and 
effective briefs often include one.  Writing an introduction allows you to 
succinctly (no more than 2 pages) introduce the basic facts and law the Court 
needs to understand to rule your way.  Consider asking yourself, “If I had 
one minute to tell another lawyer who is not an expert in this subject area 
what this appeal is all about and why my client should win, what would I 
say?”] 
JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT1 
[Insert a sentence or short paragraph describing: (1) the basis for jurisdiction 
for the lower court, agency or board, with reference to the specific statute 
conferring jurisdiction (e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1331); (2) the basis for jurisdiction for the 
Court of Appeals, with reference to the specific statute conferring jurisdiction (e.g., 
28 U.S.C. § 1291); (3) the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from; 
the date of filing of the notice of appeal or petition for review; and the statute or 
rule under which it is claimed the appeal is timely; and (4) whether the appeal is 
from a final order or judgment that disposes of all parties’ claims, or information 
establishing the court of appeals’ jurisdiction on some other basis.]  
[In a criminal case, include the defendant’s bail status.  If the defendant is in 
custody, the projected release date should be included.]  
[In a petition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, 
state whether petitioner (1) is detained in the custody of the Department of 
1If you are filing an answering brief, you do not need to include a jurisdictional 
statement, the statement of issues, the statement of the case, or the standards of 
review, if you agree entirely with the opening brief’s discussion of those sections.  
If you are filing a reply brief, you do not need to (and in fact should not) repeat the 
jurisdictional statement, the statement of issues, the statement of the case, or the 
standards of review section(s).  Moreover, you should not simply repeat arguments 
made in your opening brief, but instead respond to your opponent’s responses. 
2 
Homeland Security or at liberty and/or (2) has moved the Board of Immigration 
Appeals to reopen or applied to the district director for an adjustment of status.]  
[Practice Tip: Include citations to the excerpts of record to establish the 
timeliness of the appeal.] 
STATUTORY [AND REGULATORY] AUTHORITIES 
[Although not required under the rules, you may reproduce the text of the 
governing constitutional, statutory, or regulatory authority here.  Doing so, 
however, will count against the total number of words in the brief.  Alternatively, 
you may include a sentence like, “All relevant statutory [and/or constitutional 
and/or regulatory] authorities appear in the Addendum to this brief”; text of the 
relevant provisions in an Addendum is not counted against the word count.] 
ISSUE(S) PRESENTED 
[Identify the issue or issues that you are presenting to the Court of Appeals.] 
[Practice Tip: In listing the issue(s) presented, tell the Court what the issues 
are in a brief and succinct way – preferably one that suggests the answer you 
want without being too argumentative, such as “Whether the district court 
erred in holding that Plaintiff lacked standing where he sufficiently alleged 
that Defendant’s conduct directly caused him to lose his job.”  Each issue 
presented should be one sentence long.  If there is more than one issue, 
number each one. Ideally, to guide the Court, each issue presented would 
map on to each major argument heading (i.e., the Roman numeral headings 
below), so if the Argument section contains parts I, II, and III, there would 
be three issues presented listed here.] 
3 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
[Insert a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the 
issues submitted for review, describing the relevant procedural history, and 
identifying the rulings presented for review, with appropriate references to the 
record (see FRAP 28(e)).]  
[Practice Tip: “Every assertion in the briefs regarding matters in the record, 
except for undisputed facts offered only for general background, shall be 
supported by a citation to the Excerpts of Records, unless the filer is exempt 
from the excerpts requirement.”  See Ninth Cir. R. 28-2.8.  In Social 
Security Appeals, the parties should cite to the certified administrative 
record as well as the excerpts of record.  See Ninth Cir. R. 30-1.6 and 30
1.4(e). In immigration cases, the parties should cite to the certified 
administrative record and addendum containing the relevant orders.  See 
Ninth Cir. R. 28-2.7.  Citations should be in the form [volume number (if 
more than one)]-[ER (or SER or FER for supplemental and further excerpts 
of record)]-[page number(s)]—for example, 2-ER-345, or ER-67 (for a 
single-volume ER), or 1-SER-234 (for the first volume of a multivolume 
SER).  See Ninth Cir. R. 30-1.6.  These should be specific citations to 
particular pages of the excerpts of record to which the Court can refer (e.g., 
“1-ER-234–36”), not large page ranges.  Best practice is to include a specific 
record citation after every sentence in the Statement.  Failure to adequately 
cite to the record may result the Court striking your brief. 
The statement of the case is your first real opportunity to draw the reader in, 
explain what the case is about, and convince the reader to care about it.  It 
should read like a story of what happened, not a minute order summarizing 
the proceedings below.  Tell a story that is interesting, compelling, and 
makes the reader want to side with your client.   
Generally, the statement of the case should include the facts relied upon in 
your argument section.  However, you need not include every detail in the 
4 
statement of facts.  You can elaborate further in the argument section when 
doing so will make it easier for the reader to digest the additional detail.   
Don’t avoid inconvenient facts.  If you leave out an important fact that 
seems to benefit your opponent, the judges will notice the omission, and 
they will start to wonder if you are omitting other relevant information as 
well.  If the judges start doubting your credibility as they read your 
statement of the case, you will be in trouble by the time they get to your 
legal argument.]  
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
[Insert a summary of the argument(s), which must (1) contain a succinct, 
clear, and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and 
(2) not merely repeat the argument headings.] 
[Practice Tip: To guide the reader, the summary of argument should 
generally follow the same organization as the Argument section.  It can be 
effective to begin each paragraph in the Summary with the Roman numeral 
(e.g., “II.”) of the Argument section summarized by the paragraph.] 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
[Concisely state the applicable standard of review for each issue presented, 
including a citation of the relevant statute or Ninth Circuit decision setting forth the 
standard.  In addition, if you are the party disputing a ruling on appeal, and the 
ruling is one to which a party must have objected at trial to preserve a right of 
review, e.g., a failure to admit or to exclude evidence, or the giving of or refusal to 
give a jury instruction, state where in the record on appeal the objection and ruling 
are set forth.]  
5 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
[Insert appropriate heading for the argument on issue #1] 
[There are several acceptable ways to use capitalization in your argument 
headings.  Some attorneys prefer to use sentence case (capitalizing only the first 
letter of the first word, as above) for all headings because it tends to be easiest to 
read.  Other attorneys prefer to use all uppercase for major headings, title case 
(capitalizing the first letter of every word) for subheadings, and sentence case for 
the remaining headings. The choice is yours.] 
[Insert your first argument: this must include an identification of your 
contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of 
the record on which the appellant relies]  
[Practice Tip: Begin the argument section of your brief with your strongest 
argument.  Omit implausible or weak arguments.  Be straightforward about 
the case’s strengths and weaknesses and address weaknesses head on.  If you 
are the appellant, don’t just argue why you are right, explain why the district 
court got it wrong.  Address case or statutory authority relied on by the 
lower court.  Don’t waste time arguing obvious or undisputed points.  Don’t 
use boilerplate, especially regarding well-established standards, but if there 
is a controlling standard, include it.]  
[Practice Tip: There are two acceptable ways to address the standard of 
review.  See FRAP 28(a)(8)(B).  You can include a standalone “Standard of 
Review” section before your “Argument” section, as illustrated above.  See 
FRAP 28(a)(8)(B).  Or you can begin each major section of your argument 
with a subsection that addresses the standard of review for that particular 
issue.  This option may be particularly appropriate when your brief presents 
numerous issues with different applicable standards or if the standard of 
review is disputed, complex, or dispositive.] 
6 
[Practice Tip: The Ninth Circuit’s website includes an outline of standards 
of review, which can be a useful starting point for your research. 
http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000368] 
B. 
[Insert appropriate subheading for the subargument on the first 
issue] 
[Using subheadings within major arguments can help guide the reader 
through the progression of your argument.  For clarity, try to avoid including more 
than three levels of subheadings (e.g., I/A/1).  Two levels should generally suffice.  
Make your arguments here.  Do not incorporate by reference briefs or pleadings 
filed before the district court, or before this Court in a prior appeal.] 
[Text] 
[Text] 
[Text] 
II. 
1. [Insert appropriate subheading for the sub-subargument on 
issue #1.B.1, if this level of headings is necessary] 
2. [Insert appropriate subheading for the sub-subargument on 
issue #1.B.2] 
[Insert appropriate heading for the argument on issue #2] 
[Insert your second argument (if applicable).  Repeat for each additional 
argument.] 
CONCLUSION 
[Insert a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought from the Court, 
such as “For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be 
7 
reversed, and the case remanded for trial [or for an evidentiary hearing, for 
consideration of Plaintiff’s claims on the merits, etc.].”]  
[Practice Tip: Generally, the conclusion should contain one sentence that 
tells the Court specifically what you want it to do and what directions it 
should give the district court.]

[Practice Tip:  Under Ninth Circuit Rule 28-2.6, each party must identify in a 
statement on the last page of its initial brief any known related case pending in the 
Ninth Circuit.  Cases are deemed “related” if they: (a) arise out of the same or 
consolidated cases in the district court or agency; (b) raise the same or closely 
related issues; or (c) involve the same transaction or event.  The statement should 
include the name and appellate docket number of the related case and describe its 
relationship to the case being briefed.  The purpose of this rule is to alert the parties 
and the Court to other known cases pending in this Court that might affect how the 
instant case is managed or decided.  This rule does not require counsel to list all 
known cases raising the same or closely related issues if the list would be lengthy 
and counsel in good faith believes that listing the cases would not assist the Court 
or other parties.  If you don’t know of any other related cases in this Court, no 
statement is required.  If you are the appellee, you don’t need to include any related 
cases identified by the appellant.]

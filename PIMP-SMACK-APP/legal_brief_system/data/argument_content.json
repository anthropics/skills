The systematic denial of access to courts, destruction of legal files, and prolonged unlawful detention after court-ordered release demonstrate clear constitutional violations that the district court erroneously dismissed."

The district court erred in dismissing access to courts claims because the destruction of 62 legal files and systematic rejection of filings caused actual injury to Appellant's ability to pursue legal remedies.\n\nII. The district court erred in finding no due process violation because Appellant was held seven days beyond his court-ordered release date and was denied discovery fourteen times.\n\nIII. The district court erred in dismissing Monell claims because Appellant sufficiently alleged official policy through the pattern of constitutional violations by county officials."

Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821 (1977). To state a claim for denial of access to courts, a plaintiff must show actual injury—that the defendant's actions hindered the plaintiff's efforts to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 351 (1996).\n\nHere, on June 20, 2022, at 5:10 PM, a jail guard deliberately deleted 62 of Appellant's legal files during dinner lockdown. (ER-102.) These files contained critical evidence and legal arguments for Appellant's pending claims. The deletion occurred while Appellant was confined and unable to protect his property.\n\nThis destruction directly caused actual injury..."

FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

TYLER ALLEN LOFALL,
    Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
CLACKAMAS COUNTY, et al.,
    Defendants-Appellees.

Appeal from the United States District Court
for the District of Oregon
No. 3:24-cv-00839-SB
Hon. Stacy Beckerman

INTRODUCTION

This appeal arises from the district court's dismissal of Appellant's civil rights claims. The court erred in multiple respects that warrant reversal.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).

STATEMENT OF ISSUES

1. Whether the district court erred in dismissing Appellant's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

2. Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Appellant's motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Appellant filed his complaint on March 15, 2024. See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944).

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

The district court committed reversible error. This Court should reverse and remand.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

This Court reviews de novo the district court's dismissal. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).

ARGUMENT

I. The District Court Erred in Dismissing the Complaint

The complaint stated a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The district court's contrary conclusion was error.

A. The Legal Standard

Under Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), a complaint must plead facts sufficient to state a claim.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should reverse the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.

Respectfully submitted,

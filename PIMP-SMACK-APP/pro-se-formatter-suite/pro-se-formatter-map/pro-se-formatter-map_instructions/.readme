WE.[READ FIRST]

1) Read `SUITE_INDEX.md` (suite-wide index, identical copy)
2) Read `LEGAL_DOCUMENT_DRAFTING_MAP.md` (framework map)
3) For filing-type structure and H1 outlines, read the taxonomy skill files (use cited sources for jurisdiction requirements)

WE.[MODE SELECTION]
- Choose exactly one per run:
  - evidence_backed_mode
  - user_asserted_mode (must list assumptions + unknowns)

WE.[NON-NEGOTIABLES]
- Local rules/certificates: use cited sources.
- Evidence UID system: preserve UIDs exactly as provided.
- One skill = one document-part/topic. Compose by orchestrating multiple skills.

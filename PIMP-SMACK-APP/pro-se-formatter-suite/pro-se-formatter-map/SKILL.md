# Pro Se Formatter Suite — Map

WE.[READ FIRST]
- Always read `pro-se-formatter-map_instructions/.readme` first.
- Then read `pro-se-formatter-map_instructions/LEGAL_DOCUMENT_DRAFTING_MAP.md`.
- Use taxonomy via the taxonomy skill files; use cited sources for jurisdiction requirements.

WE.[NON-NEGOTIABLES]
- Jurisdiction rules/certificates: use cited sources.
- Evidence UID system: preserve UIDs exactly as provided.
- One skill = one topic/document-part. Compose by orchestrating multiple skills.

This skill is the suite’s **routing and read-order** entry.

It is framework-first (no local rule invention) and exists to keep the other formatter subskills from getting mixed into unrelated skills.

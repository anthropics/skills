okay great... can we do this ... can we make the entire set up be under a single skills section so that the skills that inside the classified section are for the formatter, and that all sub sections inside there dont get mixed up or lost from the other skills? because i have alot of skills aready set up and some of them are linked to the anthropic repo and i dont want them to get updated off the repo, and i want the repo to be used for the conditions that it is indended for this would leave us the master class... AND

FYI to add some fun to the mix i have a theme that isnt court appropriate but i guarentee its how the pro se litigent feels when hes stuck doing this... obviously if the pro se litigent is going through the difficulty of doing this by that time he feels deeply wronged.. and is very likely that the wrong that he is feeling has caused much of the difficulty of the situation financially that blocks him from escaping the clutches binding him to personally not be able to do this. 

SOOO i came up with something kinda funny and would help the pro se know that he has all the steps handled that need to be handled.... if we take a typical law suit there is stages.... you have 1. the notice, 2. complaining 3. discovery, 4. pretrial motions/ROA's 5. evidence submission, 6. trial prep/witnesses, 7. trial. 8. post trial motions 9. appeals  .... and so forthe .... and i know these change alot but if you are aware of each of these sections you will have alot better chance at success... and to be successful you really need to have all of these fall into an aligh.... maybe not appeal if you do it right but chances are you will have something from each one of these sections if you are pro se. 

and i also am trying to set up a the "pimp slap" theme... this is where the model makes a card that is like a freeze frame of filing if inserted into the court admesphere. where the model  takes the specs and in a pre set template inserts the key features of the filing, and makes a cartoon funny animation of the defendants getting pimp smacked with like sweat and tears freeze framed  with a goofy bug eyed face of the defendants.. the pro se plaintiff wearing a white pimp glove, and dominating the situation....  the people all have big heads, the lawyers on the other side looking slimey and slicked hair or evil getting pimp smacked backed!  and depending on what situation or portion of the  litigation it is in it should have the numbered card of the situation... and once you collect all the pimp smack cards then you have had all the sections of the case created and that way you dont leave any of them out....  its an over the top funny way to keep them engaged and focused....  so they dont leave out say evidence submission, just by not knowing they even need to hold an evidence hearing... these should auto save to a dir where the created files get saved  and be called something funny like the "path to pimpness" or something and it should be pretty well defined so that the models can make the characters in the pimp deck pretty much the same every picture.... it doesnt have to be the exact perosn picture.. but it would be funny or a cool addition if the people could give their own picture and be the pimp... but it can default and be mine and the clackamas county who im against would be a great defautl defendants crooks ...  and they can get pimp smacked by the pro se litigants all over world in cartoon versions .

okay forget the pimp cards ill do those on my own... but can you please make the file structure of the skills library so that we have this alll contained inside its onw dir.... and i dont want to have any types on there that dont end up with its own template skills dir .... so each one of the types and each one of the sections and stuff needs to have its own subskill....  and each subskill needs to be the formatted sections of 1 particualy topic.. there isnt going to be the formatting of more than 1 thing, 1 doc, 1 sections at a time... for example when i format something from the ninth cir. the model would pull the template, see that there is a coverpage, a document body, if there is a declaration or something, then the they would add those.. but then the model would pull both the skills and do them then merge them (this means that we need a merge skill, a table of authorities skill, and a table of contents skill that pulls fromt he other document parts) soooo the model making the package will actuallyl need to format the first part, create the caption or title page, for example my 'ninthcir coverpage' skill that is already built in xml is a perfect example. and the "skill creator" that is already in there should be the guild becuase it  holds the creation or the skill requirements. already .

okay that is perfect can you name the mapping features that need to be read first clearly. and maybe start them out with we  .\[instructions] or somethiong that is really clear on how that works for both people and model..... its obvious that the model will need to read this but sometimes when the model is reaching in to read out dir it has to be fairly specific or they cant read it and miss it.... also as long as its inside the  the "pro-se-formatter-suite" dir you can and should make absolutely as many dir as you need to in order to make this a complete fully functional tool.... tools that windows makes often have hundreds of folders like this that opperate like cabinet files, and i dont want you to be limited to these.... (look at node or python packages they have thousands alone.) I dont want you to opperate any of these scaffolding processes with sub processes however, i would like the LLM to make the decisions for the most part and with the users  considerations.  ... so that being said please do create as many of these folders as you need to to do this... also dont worry about any issues with the /root of the skills folder, once this is complete, and mapped correctly, what we can do is copy them all out of the building root folder make sure they are on a skingle skills file inside the md, and then put them inside the the already generated skill folder, with the mapped  exact names and then model can filter though and find them, but this will keep them togeher for now why it gets built, and prevent duplicates from polluting the working dir that i use at this moment with the other files... and it wil also add a new independant option where we can save the dir into a space and independantly use it at the skills.  now anymodel can use the skills, its just so happens that claude set up a good standard and thats why we are using his.. I also can upload these directly into my claude code.... and it wont be long before Openai, or any of the others build a similar situation. same thing Anthropic did with the MCP servers where the entire world was trying to build those tools... they set the tone because of the amount of developers that use Claude Code that they all took the same naming and format and that format took hold as the standard.... skills is begiining to do as well... so this is a good practice at this early stage that we follow the format and functions of this already set in place thing..... we dont want to multi stack tools  and we dont want any  of the tools to need to be changed on the fly... it adds room for too many errors. BUT witrh them all  having a single functions, this allows the models to only need to read and use whats relevent... and even not read some files it calls knowing they work.... this will keep context control where it needs to be. on the actual text and creation of whats relevent. 

SOOOOO what i want you to do... so stop validaating it unless your validator has changed it passes shit that doesnt pass the injesting at claude code .... and that each skill needs its onwn dir, its own license copy, its own SKILL.md file, and it needs 1 sub dir with the instructions inside of it... so in the first 2 layers of each skill you will have :

level 1: the name of the skill (make this have something to do with what it does) - ((THIS IS EXACTLY 1 DIR))
level 2: 
a. "SKILL.md" [#18](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/issues/18)SKILL.md (this must be named "SKILL.md")
b. #LICENSE (these can all be the same but they need to be there)
c. dir housing all instructions. (for best practices name it "[name_of_skill]_instructions")
level 3: the only level three there will be will be inside the instructions dir, and inside this  you should start with the readme and so that its ontop add a ".readme" and inside each readme i want you to have it the same format in the same order, and whether having it so that it can be programatically updated  however you would do that or have as a seperate file, I want inside each of these  .readme or seperate as a mapping file. the exact tree structure of all of the files once complete this way from any dir or skill it can be seen that there should be xyz included in the creation of any of the other skills and that way things are not left out that the model didnt know that needed to go with that skill. for example the coverpage with the declaration .; and it may even be best to have a "merge" as a third skill that gets used there may be a whole sub category of the skills that are marked as "utility skills" that would be something like "merge", "print to pdf", "page numbers", "inventory", "fact_finder" <whatever it becomes.>  then it may be important to have these in their own sections.... the only thing im asking and saying here.... is that no matter what the mapping structure turns out ... if we can have the an index that is identical to all over skills  thats get inserted either in the readme files of every skill in the toolbox, or duplicated in every skill dir so that every dir has its own copy of the same map that maps all of the pro-se skills were setting up. 

and you very well might have 10 files in a complex skill instructions folder. but what i ideally want to have when this is said and done.... is the a numbered order the model calls the skills without having to read the files... and this auto creates the files in perfect format from the models assisted text files properly.

what i want you to do also if you could... i want  you to for now in the root folder to include my responses for today that explain the entire process word for word dont re-wordify what ive said... because i want it said like i said it.. and dont want things left out.... as you heard them ... because what i say and what you heard (although good to know what you are missing) is seldom exactly the same.. and having this  exact thing i said in there would allow for another model to review the project and find out if there is anything missed. and if you could copy the messages i said and put them in the root folder and a '.master_instructions_plan' that would be amazing

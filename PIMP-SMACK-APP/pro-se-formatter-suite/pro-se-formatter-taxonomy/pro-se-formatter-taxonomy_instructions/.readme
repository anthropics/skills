READ FIRST

1) Read `SUITE_INDEX.md` (suite-wide index, identical copy)
2) Read `filing_types_federal_baseline.json` (filing types + assembly contract + Body H1 outlines)
3) Read `rules_workspace_federal_template.json` (workspace for source-backed requirements)
4) Optional reference: `heading1_groups_baseline.json` (legacy glossary/back-compat)

PURPOSE

This taxonomy provides a practical baseline set of common federal filing types (including judgments), plus a deterministic assembly contract that downstream code can call by stable slot identifiers.

CORE TERMS (WHAT THESE FIELDS MEAN)

- Filing type (`filing_types[TYPE]`)
  - A document-kind record.
  - Carries a definition, a per-type assembly order (`CONSTRUCT_Order`), and a Body outline (`body_headings_h1`).

- Construct slots (`CONSTRUCT_SLOTS.slots`)
  - Canonical callable identifiers for document parts.
  - These strings serve as the stable interface for assembly code.

- Template parts (`template_parts`)
  - Documentation for each construct slot.
  - Specifies purpose + expected inputs for building that part.

- Body H1 outline (`body_headings_h1`)
  - The ordered Heading-1 section outline used inside the Body part.
  - Drives section structure and supports TOC generation.

ASSEMBLY CHAIN (HOW TO USE THIS FILE)

1) Choose a filing type key (example: `motion`, `opposition`, `reply`, `opening_brief`).
2) Load `CONSTRUCT_SLOTS` + `template_parts` to resolve slot identifiers and their required inputs.
3) Read `filing_types[TYPE].CONSTRUCT_Order` to get the per-type build sequence of construct slots.
4) Build the Body content using `filing_types[TYPE].body_headings_h1`.

RULES WORKSPACE (WHERE CITED REQUIREMENTS LIVE)

- Use `rules_workspace_federal_template.json` to store citations and extracted requirements (word limits, formatting deltas, conferral, certificates).
- Keep each requirement tied to sources so later automation can trace it.

INVARIANTS

- Evidence UID system: preserve UIDs exactly as provided by the external evidence system.
- Local rules / certificates: populate requirements from cited sources.

      "significance": "The Sixth Amendment requires, at a minimum, that counsel (or an advisor) not actively work against the defendant. Here, court-appointed advisor Medina, who had no authority to make decisions, abandoned his role and became an agent of the prosecution. He colluded with the DA, lied to the court, and engineered the cancellation of a trial his client was prepared to win. This is a structural failure of the adversarial system.",

Medina's act of lying to the court on behalf of the prosecution falls far below the 'objective standard of reasonableness' required of counsel, and the prejudice is the trial cancellation and prolonged incarceration.",
          "caselaw2": "United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984): This case is crucial as it outlines circumstances where ineffective assistance is so profound that prejudice is presumed, such as when 'counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.' By actively colluding with the DA, Medina did not just fail to test the prosecution's case; he actively aided it, triggering a presumption of prejudice."

Instead of advising his pro se client, he acted as an agent for the state, providing the court with the same false information as the DA to achieve the state's goal of delaying the trial. This is not mere ineffective assistance but a hostile act against his own client's interests.",

Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994): This case establishes that for a § 1983 malicious prosecution claim to proceed, the underlying criminal proceedings must have terminated in the plaintiff's favor.

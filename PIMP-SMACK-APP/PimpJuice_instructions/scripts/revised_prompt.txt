I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1  
Tyler Allen Lofall, Plaintiff in this action, submits this 
Amended Complaint against the following defendants: Clackamas County, 
West Linn Police Department, Officer Dana Gunnarson, Officer Catlin 
Blyth, Clackamas County Sheriff’s Department, Clackamas County Jail, 
Deputy District Attorney Rebecca Portlock, and John Does 1-2. 
2  
This case arises from a series of actions beginning in March 
2022, involving false arrest, malicious prosecution, unlawful detention, 
denial of adequate medical care, and various other constitutional violations 
committed by the defendants under color of state law. These actions resulted 
in the Plaintiff suffering ongoing harm, including the loss of an Assignment 
of Benefits valued at $111,943.56 and the dismissal of a counterclaim 
valued at $32,599.50 in a separate legal matter, both of which occurred due 
to the Defendants' interference and obstruction. 
3  
The Plaintiff initially filed separate claims in state and 
federal courts. However, the Plaintiff's federal claim, which included the 
State of Oregon, was dismissed due to sovereign immunity. The Plaintiff 
8 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
now amends the complaint to remove the State of Oregon while maintaining 
the claims against the remaining defendants. The Plaintiff seeks to 
consolidate all claims under federal jurisdiction to ensure that the full extent 
of the constitutional violations and damages can be addressed in a single 
proceeding. 
4  
Furthermore, Plaintiff requests the Court toll the statute of 
limitations due to the tolling provided by memoranda issued during the state 
of emergency in 2022, the ongoing nature of the litigation in state court, and 
the discovery of new harms in May 2024. The Plaintiff argues that the delay 
in filing these claims, caused by ongoing legal resistance from the 
Defendants, should not preclude a fair adjudication of his claims. The 
Plaintiff asserts that despite these efforts, he has consistently acted in good 
faith to pursue his claims and deserves his day in court to present the facts 
and seek redress for the harms suffered. 
5  
The Plaintiff asserts violations of his Fourth, Fifth, 
Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as claims under 42 
U.S.C. § 1983, including unlawful detention, malicious prosecution, 
conspiracy to deprive civil rights, failure to train, and destruction of 
property/claim rights. These claims are supported by substantial evidence, 
9 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
including the Plaintiff’s Declaration Narrative, which is incorporated 
herein as the Factual Background. 
6  
This narrative details the series of events and systemic 
failures leading to the harms suffered by the Plaintiff, and the narrative 
demonstrates the intentionality and negligence of the Defendants in 
violating the Plaintiff’s rights. 
7  
The Plaintiff requests this Court exercise its jurisdiction over 
all claims, including those against the West Linn Defendants, while 
maintaining the option to separate claims involving the West Linn 
Defendants if necessary. The Plaintiff contends that the interconnected 
nature of the claims makes it imperative that they be heard together to 
ensure justice is served. Should the federal court decline jurisdiction over 
specific parties, the Plaintiff requests that those parties be severed and 
removed from the complaint as needed. 
10 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Additional Legal Context 
The Plaintiff’s amended complaint includes claims under the following legal 
provisions: 
• 42 U.S.C. § 1983: Civil rights violations, including unlawful detention, 
malicious prosecution, and denial of equal protection. 
• Fourth Amendment: Protection against unreasonable searches and 
seizures, including false arrest and unlawful detention. 
• Fifth Amendment: Protection against deprivation of life, liberty, or 
property without due process of law. 
• Seventh Amendment: Right to a civil trial, which was unjustly denied to 
the Plaintiff. 
• Fourteenth Amendment: Guarantee of due process and equal protection 
under the law, which the Plaintiff asserts were violated through the systemic 
actions of the Defendants. 
11 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
II. 
JURISDICTION AND VENU 
8  
This Court possesses federal-question jurisdiction over this 
matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as the action involves claims arising 
under the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
9  
Specifically, the claims are grounded in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 
concerning alleged violations of the Plaintiff’s civil rights as protected 
under federal law. . 
10  
Venue is appropriately established in this District under 28 
U.S.C. § 1391. The justification for this is Multifaceted: firstly, a substantial 
portion of the events or omissions that form the basis of the claims 
transpired within this District; secondly, the Defendants either reside or can 
be found within this District, Moreover, as time ticked away, more alike 
actions revealed their self, and Lofall being ensnared with additional 
difficulties upon his unlawful arrest. With the state creating the maximum 
delays the federal government is the only one who can simply have the right 
to correct the violations the state failed to do so, is refusing to do so, and 
flat out cannot deny doing so.  
12 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
11  
The State, to judge its own wrong doing, would be one thing 
if It was correcting its self, but its not, especially when its actions and those 
representing the state are striving for procedural unfairness as surpassing its 
duty to Constitutional right protections, further cementing the 
appropriateness of this venue. 
12  
Under Article III, Section 2 of the United States 
Constitution, the federal judiciary is vested with the authority to adjudicate 
all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, our laws, and 
treaties of the United States. This includes cases where a citizen asserts a 
violation of rights granted by the federal constitution against their state, 
particularly when seeking injunctive relief. Such cases inherently "arise 
under this Constitution," hence falling within the ambit of federal 
jurisdiction. 
13  
Given the context of this case – where the state court has 
failed to rectify the issue, despite being afforded the opportunity to do so – 
the federal court's intervention becomes imperative. The state court's 
inaction, characterized by procedural delays, risks eclipsing the statute of 
limitations and denies the Plaintiff the opportunity for redress. This federal 
13 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
court, therefore, is not only appropriate but necessary to adjudicate the 
claims presented, ensuring the enforcement of constitutional rights and the 
provision of timely justice.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
1. March 4-6, 2022: Initial Incidents of Property Damage and Harassment 
37  
On March 4, 2022, Plaintiff, Tyler A. Lofall, began 
experiencing severe harassment and property damage at his residence, 
perpetrated by an individual named Macy (‘Massiel Galla’), whom was a 
friend and the owner of the West Linn Property. Over the course of three 
days, Macy, on a substance abuse bender, engaged in a pattern of destructive 
behavior, including smashing windows, pouring 30 pounds of flour each of 
21 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
three days through the broke out windows onto Plaintiff’s bed, electronics, 
clothes, and damaging his tools, and property beyond repair. (See Exhibit 
26 page 25) 
38  
Stemming from jealousy and substance abuse, on March 4th, 
Macy smashed multiple windows, rendering them unusable, purchased 5 
gallons of gasoline, and threatened to burn down the house and plaintiffs 
items, taking his keys and work files in retaliation of his lack of attention 
due to a separate legal matter taking an enormous amount of his time. (See 
exhibit 18)  
39  
Officers Clearly state “Upon arrival I observed a window 
on the bottom level of her house broken. Officer Amendola made 
contact with Massiel. Massie I appeared to be extremely frustrated. 
MasseIi informed us that she has asked Tyler to leave her house 
multiple times. Due to Tyler refusing to leave her house, Masseli 
threatened to burn the house down” (See Exhibit 7 page 2) 
40  
So she had asked Plaintiff to leave, while holding his truck 
keys, and work files, a clear violation of Plaintiffs rights. Officers not 
22 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
having a duty or authority to make Plaintiff leave, however had a duty and 
authority to protect Plaintiff, yet despite his requests, the damages, and the 
threats they heard with their own ears they did nothing. (See Exhibit 26 Page 
25) 
41  
The officers left the 5 Gallons of gasoline even though both 
officers and dispatch heard, were aware of the complaint Plaintiff was 
claiming, its in the officers reports about the windows being pounded out, 
and threats to him by Macy to burn down the house. See Exhibit 
42  
On March 5th, she continued her destructive actions, causing 
extensive damage to Plaintiff’s personal and professional equipment. By 
March 6th, Macy had attacked Plaintiff with a hammer and hose, further 
escalating the violence and destruction from Plaintiff’s property to Plaintiff 
him self (Exhibits 19 & 20; Exhibit 21). 
2. March 4-6, 2022: Plaintiff’s Attempts to Seek Police Assistance 
43  
In response to Macy’s aggressive actions, Plaintiff contacted 
the West Linn Police Department (WLPD) multiple times, reporting Macy’s 
violent behavior and the ongoing destruction of his property. Despite these 
urgent calls for help, the WLPD failed to intervene or take effective action 
23 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
to protect Plaintiff from further harm. Plaintiff was trying to leave the 
property but Macy had his work files and keys, preventing him from doing 
so. The police dispatch records from March 4th, 2022, indicate that Plaintiff 
made several reports detailing Macy’s threats and violent behavior. 
However, the officers on duty did not respond adequately to these calls, 
allowing Macy’s harassment and property damage to continue unchecked 
(Exhibit 4). 
3. March 5, 2022: Escalation of Aggression 
44  
On March 5, 2022, Macy’s aggression escalated when she 
forcibly broke through the windows of Plaintiff’s residence using a hammer 
and hose. She subsequently poured water and flour inside the home, causing 
significant damage to Plaintiff’s belongings and rendering his electronics 
unusable. This act of violence was captured in photographs that clearly 
depict Macy attacking Plaintiff with a hammer and hose, providing 
undeniable evidence of her aggressive behavior and contradicting any 
claims that Plaintiff was the aggressor (Exhibits 19 & 20; Exhibit 21). 
4. March 6, 2022: Unlawful Arrest of Plaintiff 
45  
On March 6, 2022, in response to the ongoing harassment 
and property damage reports, WLPD officers Dana Gunnarson and Catlin 
Blyth arrived at Plaintiff’s residence. Within eight minutes of their arrival, 
24 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
without conducting a thorough investigation or establishing probable cause, 
Officers Gunnarson and Blyth arrested Plaintiff on allegations of 
harassment. This swift arrest was conducted in a manner that lacked due 
diligence and relied heavily on biased and incomplete information, 
indicating a prejudiced approach to Plaintiff’s detention (Exhibit 23).  
46  
For example, Plaintiff may have knocked on Macys 
windows, however it was specifically because she had pounded out all the 
windows, and the door, Plaintiff was soaking wet from the multiple hoses 
inside the house, Macy then cut the power, the heat, the internet, the lights, 
the Water, and it was in the low 20’s and Plaintiff had every right to have 
the utilities left on. Moreover, WLPD with a Duty to intervene Did nothing, 
however they knew that Plaintiff was repeatedly getting attacked, they even 
left the gasoline with Macy as she remained screaming  at everyone in the 
yard including the officers and stated in front of them that she was going to 
burn everything  mean while her children look out the window from inside 
the house. Non of this was included in any of the reports to ‘why’ Plaintiff 
was knocking on the windows 
5. Bias in Investigation and Suppression of Evidence 
47  
Officer Gunnarson’s investigation report submitted to the 
court reveals significant bias and a lack of thoroughness. The report 
25 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
misrepresented the events at Plaintiff’s residence by omitting evidence of 
Macy’s aggressive actions and instead portraying Plaintiff as the primary 
aggressor. Additionally, the Domestic Violence Assessment Surveys 
(Exhibit 5) indicate that Macy did not qualify as a victim of domestic 
violence, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the charges against 
Plaintiff. Despite photographic evidence showing Macy’s violent behavior, 
the investigation report failed to acknowledge or include this critical 
exculpatory evidence (Exhibits 19 & 20; Exhibit 5; Exhibit 23). 
6. Macy’s Continued Unreliable and Violent Behavior 
48  
Macy’s actions throughout the ordeal continued to 
undermine the case against Plaintiff. On March 6, 2022, Macy attacked 
Plaintiff with a hammer, prompting Plaintiff to defend himself, which was 
not accurately reflected in police reports. Furthermore, on March 7th, 2022, 
Macy was found in possession of methamphetamine during plaintiffs 
arraignment when she was caught entering the court house, severely 
discrediting her reliability as a witness and highlighting the manipulation of 
her testimony by state officials. These actions by Macy further demonstrate 
the lack of credible evidence against Plaintiff and the ongoing harassment 
he endured (Exhibit 2). 
7. Upon Arrest, the Officers bent every truth possible 
26 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
49  
Once The Arrest began Plaintiff noticed that the officers 
were twisting his words, and through word spin the officers were looking 
for an arrest with inserting words like “only” or “at” where they instantly in 
a pre-practiced method when Plaintiff told the Officers that Plaintiff let 
Macy go and noticed her daughter, while being attacked with a hammer, she 
turned it around that [Plaintiff]  “only “ let Macy go because he noticed her 
daughter; insinuating there was worse to come if she had not come… where 
in reality Plaintiff was in self-defense. Plaintiff told Officers that he woke 
up being attacked with keys on a lanyard by Macy and she had him blocked 
from leaving he had to “bear hug” her, she later used this as her second 
incident stating he ‘slammed her” when neither of such was remotely true.  
50  
. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to note that someone 
doesn’t water their garden with work gloves, a hammer, with a wet 
basement when the prior two days that’s what happened, and on the side of 
the house with only sand on it. Or that someone doesn’t attack someone 
while home alone with them if they are scared of them. Officers’ actions 
were intentional. 
27 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
51  
Events like this followed Plaintiff throughout this time, such 
as being claimed to be high risk, a double felon, and violent, when Plaintiff 
did not even qualify for domestic violence on the survey Officer Dana 
Gunnarson took with Macy (See Exhibit 5), he wasn’t a double felon and 
has never had a violent incident in his life, in-fact until this event, never had 
a single arrest in the state of Oregon; yet every step of the way, the 
Government Agents lied just a little bit, making the overall depiction of him 
to be unjustly altered. (See Exhibit 12 page 1 and 3) and then hid the 
evidence from being used as he was denied the body camera footage 14 
times, blocking it with DHS seal. (See Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 8) 
8. Deputy District Attorney Portlock’s Involvement and Malicious Prosecution 
52  
Deputy District Attorney Rebecca Portlock, acting under 
color of state law, continued to prosecute the charges against Plaintiff 
despite the lack of probable cause. Even after Macy recanted her statements 
on June 24, 2022—admitting that Plaintiff had committed “no crimes”—
 DA Portlock persisted with the prosecution, demonstrating malice and an 
intent to unjustly detain Plaintiff. This continuation of charges in the face 
of clear exculpatory evidence exemplifies malicious prosecution and a 
disregard for Plaintiff’s constitutional rights (Exhibit 2; Exhibit 34). 
9. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Withholding of Exculpatory Evidence 
28 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
53  
Upon his arrest, Plaintiff was assigned counsel who failed to 
provide effective legal representation. His first appointed attorney withheld 
critical exculpatory evidence, including photographs depicting Macy’s 
aggressive actions with a hammer and hose (See Exhibit 19 & Exhibit 20). 
These photographs were submitted by the police but never disclosed to 
Plaintiff, severely impairing his ability to defend himself against the 
fabricated charges. This failure to provide adequate legal representation 
constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and further obstructs Plaintiff’s 
pursuit of justice (Exhibits 2 & 3; Exhibit 5). 
10. Detention at Clackamas County Jail and Prolonged Incarceration 
54  
Following his arrest, Plaintiff was detained at Clackamas 
County Jail. Although the court ordered his release on July 1, 2022, the jail 
continued to hold Plaintiff without legal justification, ultimately releasing 
him on July 8, 2022. This unlawful extension of detention resulted in 
significant hardship for Plaintiff, including emotional distress and financial 
instability. The delay in Plaintiff’s release was not based on any new 
charges or legal reasons, highlighting systemic failures within the 
correctional facility (Exhibit 12). 
11. Destruction and Theft of Plaintiff’s Property While in Custody 
29 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
55  
During Plaintiff’s detention, his property remained 
unattended and vulnerable to theft and further damage. Despite assurances 
from Officers Gunnarson and Blyth to secure Plaintiff’s truck and 
belongings, the property was left unsecured. As a result, Plaintiff’s tools, 
electronics, and other personal items were either stolen or destroyed. Items 
that remained were submerged in tubs of water, rendering them unusable, 
and his computers were either missing or irreparably damaged. This 
negligence and breach of trust by the jail staff further compounded 
Plaintiff’s losses and hindered his ability to rebuild his life post-release 
(Exhibit 12; Exhibit 9). 
12. Denial of Medical Care and Access to Legal Resources in Jail 
56  
While incarcerated, Plaintiff was denied necessary medical 
care, exacerbating his legal blindness. Requests for contact lenses and 
proper eyewear were ignored, and instead, he was told he can order readers 
with inadequate reading glasses with a +2.00 diopter prescription, which 
did not meet his visual needs as not only is that 1/6 his script, it’s the wrong 
way (-11.00/-12.00).  
57  
Being blind a significant amount of time it made it nearly 
impossible to deal with Plaintiffs claims, he was being cheated by his own 
30 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
attorney who would only make a deal or he was blind and the jail was 
exploiting it and denying him saline solution all but one or two little cups, 
and from Plaintiff attempting to use water, he ended up ending up with an 
eye infection just to read the computer screen in the law library. 
58  
A guard named Baker deleted 62 of Plaintiffs court files on 
June 20th at exactly 5:10 PM a guard named Baker intentionally went into 
Lofalls folders in the law library and deleted specifically only his files.  
59  
It can be assumed that someone had influenced that and the 
only one that someone would have been directly on their mind would have 
had to do with DA Rebecca Portlock who Plaintiff then told was going to 
be responsible for his losses and she just got caught lying to Judge Steele to 
about having covid and she still had no evidence nor witness…(see exhibit 
1, Exhibit 12, and Exhibit 34) 
60  
Additionally, Plaintiff was denied access to the law library 
up to 9 days in a row, preventing him from preparing a defense or filing 
necessary legal documents in both his civil and criminal cases.  
31 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
61  
The jail  
staff, including Sergeant Heidi Wooster, 
systematically obstructed his access to legal resources, directly impacting 
his ability to defend himself (Exhibits 12 & 13; Exhibit 32); and cost him 
his Assignment of Benefits that he did the work for, and covered the costs 
out of his personal accounts, in full, valued at $111, 954.43, and then the 
same courts allowed him to be counter sued for another $32,599.50 while 
unable to defend his claims AND Clackamas county didn’t let him revive 
his claims when he was released, on law he was except from and was 
irrelevant. Moreover was directly denied numerous ways  as he took his 
claim to the supreme court in an attempt to revive it on appeal. (see Exhibit 
9, Exhibit 10, Exhibit 11). 
13. False Claims and Delays in Trial Proceedings 
62  
On June 10, 2022, Plaintiff was scheduled for trial and 
walked into the court dressed and ready for trial. The State unprepared they 
threw Plaintiff out of the court room “before the judge sees him” said 
Rebecca Portlock. DA Portlock and court-appointed advisor Rubin Medina 
falsely informed the court that Plaintiff had tested positive for COVID-19, 
a claim that was untrue. This misinformation led to the postponement of 
Plaintiff’s trial by six weeks, and is a violation of Plaintiffs sixth 
Amendment right to counsel in a criminal proceeding due to now having 
two corrupt counsels defend him, moreover, further delaying justice and 
32 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
denying Plaintiff a timely opportunity to defend himself. The transcript 
from June 10, 2022, reveals that this false claim was used to manipulate the 
court’s schedule and delay proceedings, showcasing a deliberate attempt to 
obstruct justice (Exhibit 1). 
14. Macy’s Recantation and Subsequent Rearrest of Plaintiff 
63  
On June 24, 2022, Macy had gone to Mexico to avoid the 
corruption from the state, after Plaintiff had been rearrested for the same 
charges. She had her children leveraged over custody implying she would 
more freely have them returned if she made statements, that [simply were 
not true] however when Plaintiff had trial reset she returned from Mexico 
early and provided testimony recanting her previous statements. She 
admitted that Plaintiff had not committed any crimes and alleged that her 
initial accusations were manipulated by the state through coercion involving 
her children. Despite Macy’s recantation, DA Portlock and Judge Steele 
refused to acknowledge her admission, leading to Plaintiff’s rearrest on the 
same unfounded charges. This action underscores the systemic bias and 
corruption within the judicial system, where exculpatory evidence was 
ignored and manipulated to continue prosecuting Plaintiff (Exhibit 2; 
Exhibit 32). 
15. Systemic Judicial and State Misconduct 
33 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
64  
Throughout Plaintiff’s detention and legal proceedings, 
there was clear evidence of systemic misconduct by judiciary and state 
officials. The appointed attorney advisor not only failed to provide effective 
legal representation but also colluded with DA Portlock and Judge Steele to 
manipulate trial outcomes. This collusion included fabricating charges, 
suppressing exculpatory evidence, and obstructing Plaintiff’s access to a 
fair trial, further violating his constitutional rights. The court transcripts and 
motions submitted by Plaintiff reveal a pattern of intentional delays and 
biased rulings that favored the Defendants over Plaintiff’s pursuit of justice 
(Exhibit 1; Exhibit 3, and Exhibit 34). 
16. Plaintiff’s Release and Continued Harassment 
65  
Although the court ordered Plaintiff’s release on July 1, 
2022, he remained incarcerated until July 8, 2022, due to ongoing 
manipulation by state officials. During this period, Plaintiff was subjected 
to further hardships, including exposure to COVID-19 and hyperthermia, as 
well as the loss of his property and professional tools. The jail report 
indicated that Plaintiff was held for an additional week without lawful 
justification, exacerbating his emotional and financial distress (Exhibit 12). 
17. Repeated Denial of Discovery and Suppression of Evidence 
34 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
66  
Plaintiff faced significant obstacles in accessing crucial 
evidence to support his defense. Despite filing for ineffective assistance of 
counsel, Plaintiff was denied access to discovery materials multiple times, 
with 14 denials while in jail. The DA and WLPD consistently suppressed 
exculpatory evidence, including body camera footage and other 
documentation that would have substantiated Plaintiff’s claims of self
defense and highlighted the Defendants’ misconduct. This systematic 
suppression of evidence severely hindered Plaintiff’s ability to present a 
coherent and truthful defense (Exhibits 3; Exhibits 7 & 8; Exhibit 32). 
67  
Moreover, the largest issue here in total, is the fact that by 
the Defendants actions they have covered up each-others liabilities or 
attempted to do so. The WLPD Covered Danas misconduct with 
Misconduct, the DA Protected West Linn by forcing a c charge that didn’t 
belong, Clackamas County attempted to lose Lofalls Files, and evidence, 
the Police Gave a car away of his and let his property get destroyed, multiple 
arrests that went unjustly, it was one big sham from arrest to release, 
Plaintiff was denied law Library, was forced to have Covid, he caused harm 
to friendships causing greater hardships once released, they tried to attack 
him in every way possible. Including taking his housing rights, his freedom, 
his petition the government, and every additional way they can lie and cause 
harm makes it harder to any win for plaintiff….. and it would surely benefit 
35 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff in these matters had they not lied to hide the body camera footage, 
then they  changed policy after Plaintiff filed because it was so obvious the 
court would have to arrest the officers under 18 U.S.C. 241, and 242.  
18. Outcome of the Charges and Dismissal 
68  
After spending 129 days in jail, the case against Plaintiff was 
dismissed the day before trial, without providing Plaintiff an opportunity to 
present his evidence and arguments. This dismissal further illustrates the 
systemic failures and the lengths to which state officials went to obstruct 
justice, effectively denying Plaintiff his day in court and violating his 
constitutional rights. The abrupt dismissal, coupled with the prior 
unwarranted delays and evidence suppression, underscores the lack of 
legitimate grounds for the charges initially brought against Plaintiff (Exhibit 
14). 
19. Impact on Plaintiff’s Life and Well-being 
69  
The cumulative actions of the Defendants have had 
devastating effects on Plaintiff’s life. As a result of the wrongful arrest, 
prolonged detention, and ongoing harassment, Plaintiff has suffered 
significant financial losses, property damage, emotional distress, and 
professional setbacks. The destruction of Plaintiff’s property, including 
tools and electronics, has not only caused financial harm but has also 
36 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
hindered his ability to work and maintain his livelihood. The loss of the 
Assignment of Benefits (AOB) valued at $111,943.56, coupled with a 
counter-suit for $32,599.50, has resulted in substantial financial instability, 
pushing Plaintiff towards homelessness and exacerbating his legal blindness 
(Exhibits 9, 21, & 24). 
20. Continued Legal Struggles and Systemic Barriers 
70  
Despite numerous attempts to seek justice through both state 
and federal courts over the past four years, Plaintiff has been consistently 
thwarted by the Defendants’ systematic efforts to deny him his 
constitutional rights. The collusion between DA Portlock, Judge Steele, and 
court-appointed advisors, coupled with ineffective legal representation, has 
perpetuated a cycle of injustice that has prevented Plaintiff his livelihood 
and caused catastrophic failures to his life. The courts denial in Justice, and 
holding Defendants accountable for their actions. The repeated delays, 
suppression of evidence, and biased rulings have further entrenched 
Plaintiff’s inability to secure justice, highlighting the urgent need for federal 
intervention to rectify these systemic failures (Exhibit 1; Exhibit 34). 
21. July 1-8, 2022: Unlawful Extension of Detention and Final Release 
71  
On July 1, 2022, the court ordered Plaintiff’s release from 
Clackamas County Jail. However, due to ongoing manipulation and lack of 
37 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
proper follow-through by the jail authorities, Plaintiff remained 
incarcerated until July 8, 2022. During this additional week, Plaintiff was 
subjected to further hardships, including exposure to COVID-19 and 
hyperthermia, as well as the continued destruction and theft of his property. 
The jail report documented that Plaintiff was held beyond the court-ordered 
release date without any lawful justification, further violating his rights and 
contributing to his deteriorating mental and physical health (Exhibit 12). 
22. Macy’s Flight to Mexico and Return 
72  
To avoid facing the consequences of her manipulated 
testimony and the ongoing corruption within the judicial system, Macy fled 
to Mexico before Plaintiff’s trial. However, upon learning that DA Portlock 
had lied to secure additional delays, Macy returned to testify on June 24, 
2022. During her hearing, Macy openly declared that she had been coerced 
and it can be heard that she was then by accusing Plaintiff exonerating her 
self and allowing grace in those who control her child’s custody…and by 
her not  doing so and wanting her children’s custody to return its obvious 
the state was using that leverage to secure a verdict to shield liability where 
the states incorrect actions cost Plaintiff his freedom and livelihood.  
38 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
73  
None the less Macy recanted her earlier statements. This 
recantation not only exonerated Plaintiff but also exposed the extent of the 
DA’s misconduct in attempting to obstruct justice (Exhibit 2). 
23. Final Summary of Systemic Failures and Rights Violations 
74  
The series of events—from the initial harassment and 
property damage by Macy, through the unlawful arrest and prolonged 
detention of Plaintiff, to the systemic corruption and suppression of 
evidence by DA Portlock and Judge Steele—demonstrate a clear pattern of 
misconduct and constitutional violations. The Defendants’ deliberate 
indifference to Plaintiff’s rights, coupled with their actions to obstruct his 
legal defense and secure unjust charges, have resulted in severe personal 
and financial harm to Plaintiff. The ongoing denial of justice and failure to 
hold Defendants accountable necessitates immediate federal intervention to 
rectify these egregious violations and ensure that Plaintiff’s constitutional 
rights are upheld (Exhibit 1; Exhibit 2; Exhibit 3; Exhibit 4; Exhibit 5; 
Exhibit 9; Exhibit 12; Exhibit 13; Exhibit 19; Exhibit 20; Exhibit 21; 
Exhibit 23; Exhibit 26; Exhibit 27; Exhibit 32; Exhibit 34). 
24. Conclusion of the Factual Background 
39 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
75  
The events described above clearly demonstrate the 
Defendants’ systematic efforts to unlawfully detain, harass, and deprive 
Plaintiff of his constitutional rights. From the initial false arrest and biased 
investigation to the prolonged and unjustified detention at Clackamas 
County Jail, the suppression of exculpatory evidence, and the collusion 
between DA Portlock and Judge Steele, each step of the process has been 
marred by misconduct and a blatant disregard for Plaintiff’s rights. These 
actions have not only caused significant financial and emotional harm to 
Plaintiff but have also highlighted the urgent need for federal oversight to 
address and rectify these systemic failures (Exhibits 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 9; 12; 13; 
19; 20; 21; 23; 26; 27; 32; 34). 
76  
V. PROBABLE CAUSE AND QUALIFIED IMMUNITY 
Argument to Defeat Qualified Immunity and Lack of Probable Cause 
(previously shut down West Linns request for judgement) 
Introduction 
77  
Plaintiff, Tyler Allen Lofall, brings this argument to 
establish that the Defendants—West Linn Police Department (WLPD) 
40 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
officers Dana Gunnarson and Catlin Blyth, Clackamas County Jail staff, and 
District Attorney Rebecca Portlock—violated clearly established 
constitutional rights. Through their actions, they engaged in an unlawful 
arrest, deliberately ignored exculpatory evidence, conspired to manipulate 
the legal process, and subjected Plaintiff to cruel and unusual punishment. 
The Defendants' claims to qualified immunity are invalid as they violated 
Plaintiff’s Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendment rights 
in a manner that no reasonable officer or prosecutor could believe was 
lawful. 
Prosecutorial Immunity Does Not Apply 
A. DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY REBECCA PORTLOCK VIOLATES THE 
TRUST OF THE PUBLIC AND THEREFORE IS NOT OWED ABSOLUTE 
IMMUNITY 
Legal Basis: 
78  
Under Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), prosecutors have 
absolute immunity for activities intimately associated with the judicial 
phase of the criminal process. 
41 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
79  
However, when a prosecutor performs administrative or 
investigative functions, or acts outside their role as an advocate, they are 
entitled only to qualified immunity. See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 
259 (1993). 
Allegations: 
80  
Acting Outside Scope of Advocacy: Deputy District Attorney 
Rebecca Portlock engaged in actions outside her role as an advocate by 
knowingly presenting false information to the court, colluding with court
appointed advisors, and manipulating legal proceedings. 
81  
Lying to the Court: DA Portlock falsely claimed that the Plaintiff 
tested positive for COVID-19 to delay the trial (Exhibit 1), which is an 
administrative act not protected by absolute immunity. 
82  
Coercion and Fabrication: Engaged in coercing witnesses and 
fabricating evidence, which are investigative functions beyond 
prosecutorial duties. 
1. Conclusion: 
42 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
83  
Because DA Portlock acted outside the scope of her prosecutorial 
duties and engaged in conduct that violated clearly established 
constitutional rights, she is not entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity. 
84  
Therefore, DA Portlock can be held liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 
for her actions that deprived the Plaintiff of constitutional rights. 
B. Violation of Clearly Established Constitutional Rights 
A. Unlawful Arrest and Lack of Investigation 
85  
On March 6, 2022, Plaintiff was unlawfully arrested by 
Officers Dana Gunnarson and Catlin Blyth within eight minutes of their 
arrival at the scene. During this brief period, the officers failed to conduct 
any meaningful investigation or question Plaintiff. Instead, they relied on 
the manipulated account provided by Macy, despite her erratic behavior and 
known mental instability. No reasonable officer would have believed that 
arresting Plaintiff based on such unreliable information was lawful, 
especially given the presence of exculpatory evidence, including witness 
statements and video evidence showing Macy as the aggressor. 
43 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
86  
The rushed arrest, absence of an investigation, and the 
failure to question Plaintiff are clear violations of the Fourth Amendment’s 
protections against unreasonable seizures. The officers' failure to obtain 
probable cause before making the arrest is further demonstrated by their 
refusal to document key evidence that could have exonerated Plaintiff. 
B. Ignoring Exculpatory Evidence 
87  
Defendants acted with deliberate bias in presenting the facts 
of the case. Despite multiple reports of Macy’s violent behavior, including 
an attack with a hammer and repeated property destruction, the WLPD 
allowed Macy to remain at the scene and continue her assaults on Plaintiff 
for three days in a row. The officers failed to document these incidents or 
take any protective actions against Macy, showing clear favoritism. 
88  
Furthermore, the loss of body camera footage, which would 
have provided critical evidence in favor of Plaintiff, suggests deliberate 
manipulation or negligence. This suppression of evidence violated 
Plaintiff’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and 
constitutes malicious intent by Defendants to deprive Plaintiff of a fair 
defense. 
44 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
C. Collusion Between the DA and Attorneys 
89  
The District Attorney’s Office, led by DA Rebecca Portlock, 
engaged in collusion with Plaintiff’s court-appointed attorneys, conspiring 
to withhold evidence and manipulate the judicial process. This collusion is 
evident in the June 24, 2022 transcript, where Macy, the state's key witness, 
recanted her testimony and accused the DA of lying about key facts in the 
case. Macy stated on the record that she never wanted to press charges and 
that the allegations against Plaintiff were based on half-truths fabricated by 
the DA. 
90  
Further evidence of collusion is found in the DA’s false 
statements to the court that Plaintiff had tested positive for COVID-19. The 
DA and Plaintiff’s attorneys deliberately removed Plaintiff from the 
courtroom, lied to the judge, and canceled the trial based on fabricated 
health concerns. This act of manipulation violated Plaintiff’s constitutional 
right to be present during his trial and to confront witnesses, further 
undermining the credibility of the charges against him. (See Exhibit 1 and 
Exhibit 2). 
91  
The state can’t force the infection of a pandemic virus and 
lie to a judge about both being prepared for trial and a defendant having 
45 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Covid while Colluding with a Pro Se Litigants forced Appointed Advisor 
and get caught doing it and expect Immunity. 
92  
D. No reasonable prosecutor or attorney could believe that such manipulation 
and deceit in a criminal case is lawful. The DA’s actions, in concert with 
Plaintiff’s attorneys, represent a clear violation of Plaintiff’s Sixth 
Amendment rights to a fair trial. 
Lack of Probable Cause 
93  
Probable cause requires that officers possess sufficient 
evidence to believe that a crime has been committed. In Plaintiff’s case, 
there was no credible evidence to support the harassment charges for which 
he was arrested.  
Moreover, the Officers looked it up in front of Plaintiff and 
plaintiff was right, yet instead of letting him go, the conspired to “cone up 
with another incident”. The officers relied solely on the statements of Macy, 
a witness with a documented history of mental instability, drug use (she was 
caught with methamphetamine in court the following day), and violent 
outbursts. Furthermore, Macy’s recantation in court made it clear that she 
did not believe Plaintiff had committed any crime. 
46 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
94  
Macy’s testimony was unreliable from the start, and the 
officers’ refusal to consider other evidence, such as video footage of Macy 
destroying property, further illustrates that they lacked probable cause to 
arrest Plaintiff. The selective use of facts and deliberate omissions in the 
police reports demonstrate that the officers acted with malicious intent, 
fabricating charges to justify an unlawful arrest. 
E. Municipal Liability 
95  
West Linn Police Department and Clackamas County are 
liable under Monell because their actions were part of a broader policy or 
custom of deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. The officers 
and jail staff involved in Plaintiff’s case acted in accordance with this policy 
of ignoring complaints, failing to investigate thoroughly, and suppressing 
evidence. Their failure to protect Plaintiff’s rights was not an isolated 
incident but rather part of a systemic failure to train and supervise 
employees adequately. 
F. Conclusion 
96  
Defendants’ actions cannot be shielded by qualified 
immunity because they violated clearly established constitutional rights that 
no reasonable officer or prosecutor could have believed were lawful. The 
47 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
unlawful arrest, suppression of exculpatory evidence, collusion in the 
courtroom, and deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s health and legal rights 
all point to a gross abuse of power. Furthermore, the absence of probable 
cause and the manipulation of legal proceedings show that the Defendants 
acted with malicious intent, not in good faith. 
97  
West Linn Police Department and Clackamas County are 
also liable under Monell for their failure to train officers and maintain 
policies that protect the constitutional rights of individuals under their 
jurisdiction. Plaintiff’s rights were systematically violated by Defendants, 
and they must be held accountable for the harm caused. 
98  
Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny 
Defendants’ claims of qualified immunity and find that there was no 
probable cause to justify Plaintiff’s arrest and detention.

71 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
VII. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS 
167  
Fourth Amendment: The Fourth Amendment guarantees 
protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. The unlawful 
seizure of the vehicle in Plaintiff’s possession, without probable cause or 
proper legal justification, constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s Fourth 
Amendment rights. Additionally, Plaintiff’s subsequent arrest and 
imprisonment were unsupported by probable cause, further violating these 
protections. 
168  
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments: Under the Due Process 
Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, Plaintiff is entitled to 
fair legal proceedings before being deprived of life, liberty, or property. 
The systemic corruption within Clackamas County, the failure of law 
enforcement officers to respond to legal filings, and the subsequent rulings 
in favor of Defendants, despite the lack of legal merit, demonstrate a blatant 
disregard for Plaintiff’s due process rights. Plaintiff was denied the 
opportunity to properly defend against false charges and hold the 
Defendants accountable, and the courts have consistently disregarded 
Plaintiff’s filings in violation of constitutional guarantees of procedural 
fairness. 
72 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
169  
Sixth Amendment: Plaintiff was deprived of the right to a 
have counsel defend him fairly and vigorously, which is a fundamental 
protection under the Sixth Amendment. Instead Plaintiffs first Appointed 
Counsel withheld exculpatory evidence, and his second appointed 
‘advisor’ the court made him take conspired with the judge and DA and 
knowingly lied about his Covid Status in order to get another set over 
leaving him in jail for 6 more weeks, despite the States only witness 
claiming Lofall “has committed no crimes” has been systematically denied 
access to a fair trial. This repeated denial of Plaintiff’s right to be heard in 
court, despite ample evidence of wrongdoing, violates the very essence of 
the Sixth Amendment. 
170  
Seventh Amendment: The Seventh Amendment guarantees 
the right to a jury trial in civil cases. Despite Plaintiff’s continuous efforts 
to present his claims, the courts have failed to ensure Plaintiff’s right to 
a jury trial. Plaintiff has not been afforded the opportunity to have his 
claims heard by a jury, despite the extensive legal filings and clear evidence 
of judicial misconduct and corruption in the handling of his case. 
73 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
171  
Fourteenth Amendment: Plaintiff was subjected to cruel and 
unusual punishment while detained, in violation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Plaintiff was deliberately placed in a cell with a COVID
positive individual, resulting in Plaintiff contracting the virus. This 
reckless and punitive action, coupled with the inhumane treatment while 
incarcerated, directly infringes upon Plaintiff’s  Amendment protections. 
172  
Equal Protection Clause (Fourteenth Amendment): Plaintiff 
has been systematically denied equal protection under the law, as 
guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The courts have consistently ruled against Plaintiff, regardless of the merits 
of his claims, and have failed to hold law enforcement and other 
governmental entities accountable for their violations. The state’s immunity 
doctrines have been abused to shield individuals from accountability, 
denying Plaintiff justice and fair treatment. District Attorney Rebecca 
Portlock even got Immunity for actions where she colluded with 
Plaintiffs Counsel and lied in Court to the Judge because she was not 
read for trial on trial day af  Lofall had spent going on 4 months in jail 
June 10th 2022. 
74 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION AND DENIAL OF RIGHTS 
173  
Plaintiff asserts that the conduct of Clackamas County, its 
law enforcement officers, the District Attorney’s office, and the judiciary 
reflect a deliberate and concerted effort to undermine Plaintiff’s 
constitutional rights. This is evidenced by the following: 
174  
Failure to Respond to Legal Filings:, Clackamas County was 
served three separate times in State Court Through the Jail and police 
Sherriffs office, and they failed to acknowledge the fact, Plaintiff served the                                                                                                                              
. This non-responsiveness demonstrates a blatant disregard for legal 
obligations and Plaintiff’s rights under the law. 
175  
Judicial Bias and Collusion: Plaintiff’s legal arguments 
against Defendant William Stabler were valid and well-supported, yet the 
court ruled in favor of the Defendant, disregarding the law and Plaintiff’s 
rights. In addition, Plaintiff contends that the District Attorney responded 
to an entirely different legal filing than the one at issue, yet still won the 
ruling. Such judicial conduct, particularly as documented in the court 
transcripts from June 10, 2022, evidences bias and corruption within 
Clackamas County’s legal system. 
75 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
176  
Perjury and Manipulation of Legal Proceedings: In case 
number 21cv02575, Defendants committed perjury, knowingly submitting 
false statements to the court while Plaintiff was falsely incarcerated. Despite 
over 75 filings by Plaintiff attempting to revive his claims, the courts have 
refused to correct these errors, and the Oregon State Bar (OSB) and federal 
court system have failed to intervene, allowing the corruption to persist 
unchecked. 
FEDERAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED 
177  
Plaintiff invokes 18 U.S.C. §§ 240-241, which explicitly 
prohibits conspiracies to interfere with civil rights and protects individuals 
from the deprivation of constitutional rights. Under this statute, federal 
courts are empowered to intervene when state or local actors conspire to 
deprive individuals of their constitutional protections. 
178  
By continuing to shield Defendants under doctrines of 
immunity and procedural technicalities, the federal court is effectively 
enabling these unconstitutional actions. Plaintiff has been repeatedly denied 
justice, and the federal court must step in to protect Plaintiff’s rights under 
the law. Failure to act would constitute complicity in the violations 
occurring at the state and county levels. 
76 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
179  
The pervasive nature of the misconduct and corruption, as 
documented in transcripts and legal filings, demonstrates that these actions 
are not isolated incidents. They are part of a broader pattern of disregard for 
Plaintiff’s constitutional rights, and federal intervention is necessary to 
restore the integrity of the legal process. 
VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
180  
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the federal court intervene 
and provide the following relief: 
181  
A declaration that the actions of Defendants, including the 
Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, the District Attorney’s Office, and the 
judiciary, violated Plaintiff’s constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, 
Sixth, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendments. 
182  
An order appointing a special master or federal oversight to 
ensure that Plaintiff’s remaining legal claims are properly adjudicated and 
that further constitutional violations are prevented. 
77 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
183  
An injunction preventing further judicial bias, manipulation, 
or retaliation against Plaintiff for exercising his legal rights. 
184  
Any additional relief the Court deems just and proper, 
including compensatory and punitive damages. 
IX. PERSONAL IMPACT 
185  
The toll of being homeless is devastating on every level—
 financially, emotionally, physically, and mentally. When I lost my home, I 
lost not just a place to sleep, but my stability, my peace of mind, and the life 
I had worked so hard to build. My car, which became my only shelter, was 
pillaged. Everything I once owned, everything I depended on, was slowly 
stripped away from me. It’s a daily battle to survive when you have to fight 
for every dollar while being completely broke, trying to defend yourself and 
keep your claim alive. Years of income, security, and self-respect vanished, 
leaving me in a constant state of desperation. 
78 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
186  
Being forced to choose between staying on the streets and 
trying to hustle enough money to survive, or learning the law on my own 
just to fight for what is rightfully mine, has been a grueling challenge. The 
very tools that I need to fight back, like my computer, have become my 
lifeline. At times, I've had to pull a weapon just to protect it, because without 
it, I have nothing. My health has deteriorated because of this relentless 
struggle. The lack of proper nutrition, medical care, and the constant stress 
have worn me down. Relationships I once cherished have frayed, torn apart 
by the strain of living a life of survival. 
187  
The daily grind of homelessness is brutal. Simple things like 
finding a bathroom before stores close or just trying to clean up so I’m not 
treated like a problem become major challenges. People look at you like 
you're a criminal everywhere you go, just because you're dirty and 
homeless. I’m constantly being accused of stealing, constantly being 
watched as if my mere existence is an offense. But despite this, I’ve fought 
hard to keep my morals intact, to not lose myself in the chaos. However, 
I’ve had to be more aggressive, more pushy, because in this situation, you 
don’t have a choice. And where has that left me? Arrested, falsely accused, 
and beaten down by a system that’s supposed to protect, not profile, me. 
79 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
188  
It started with a jealous friend who attacked me and wanted 
to take what was mine. Instead of investigating properly, the police took 
less than eight minutes to arrest me. They didn’t even bother to question 
me. They sided with the aggressor, Macy, leaving me vulnerable for three 
days in a row as she attacked me again and again. The police ignored her 
erratic behavior, the body camera footage mysteriously vanished, and they 
painted me as the problem without ever seeking the truth. 
189  
The bias was clear from the beginning—not just from the 
police, but from the courts. The entire system was stacked against me, and 
it felt like a losing battle from the start. I once had a 4.4 GPA in high school, 
a 4.0 in college, and was making over $100,000 a year for many years. But 
now, I’m scraping by, trying to survive on a few thousand a year, while 
fighting tooth and nail just to keep my claim alive. The disparity between 
who I was and what I’ve been reduced to is staggering, and the pain of losing 
everything I worked for is indescribable. 
190  
Surrounded by others who are in survival mode, I’ve seen 
firsthand how people will do anything—fight, cheat, steal—just to make it 
through another day. When you’re backed into a corner with no options, 
80 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
survival instincts kick in. And that’s what the police ignored. They didn’t 
see a man who was fighting for his life, they saw someone they could easily 
profile. They spent eight minutes on my case and decided I was guilty. They 
knew they were in the wrong. They didn’t follow the law, and they didn’t 
care. They saw me through the lens of a prior incident, one where I had 
already been profiled by a different officer, and they used that as a 
justification to treat me as less than human. 
191  
The truth is, Macy knew I wasn’t the one who hurt her. She 
bailed me out of jail. She went to Mexico and came back, calling my family 
and telling them that the government wasn’t playing fair. She knew the 
system was manipulating her, leveraging her kids over her son. She came 
to court and told the DA that they were lying, that they were telling half
truths. Macy admitted that the charges against me were false, and yet the 
DA continued to pursue them. They removed me from the courtroom to lie 
behind my back, fabricating stories about COVID, and trying to undermine 
me at every turn. 
192  
The lies were caught on tape. The transcripts prove that the 
DA, the police, and even my own attorneys colluded against me. They were 
the two-faced liars, not me. Every single person I faced lied in some way to 
81 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
harm me, thinking it would better their situation or protect their narrative. I 
never lied—not once. But in return, I’ve been dragged through the mud, my 
rights trampled on, and everything I love taken from me. 
The worst part isn’t just that they lied—it’s that the 
government, the system that’s supposed to protect constitutional rights, 
allowed this to happen. These government employees broke the law—
 federal law—and they should be held accountable. 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242, 
along with 1001, make it clear that what they did was illegal. Yet I’m the 
one suffering the consequences. They took everything from me, and the 
state protects them with procedural rules, placing them above the 
Constitution. This is why we’re one of the highest crime countries in the 
world—because the judicial branch enables this injustice to continue. 
193  
My 4.0 GPA was in psychology, and I wrote a research paper 
on this exact issue—how over-policing and [sexual] suppression leads to 
crime, teaches people to be sneaky, hide things…. The first time your forced 
to do it… it’s a big deal, the 100th time its not so much of a big deal…  The 
system isn’t helping—it’s hindering people’s lives. If the state takes 
everything from me here, it’s on them. The only thing worse than losing 
everything is the people who allow it to happen—the ones who govern it 
and let it continue… moreover, what happens if after 150 filings and being 
82 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
ran through the mud when the guy in my position gets his claims unjustly 
dismissed because the ones judging it, are corruptly sneaking away from 
their own liability?... [just walk away? Ive lost everything in my life… I’m 
just going to be honest not say…nothing]

XIII. JURY TRIAL REQUESTED 
SEVENTH AMENDMENT DEMAND FOR A CIVIL JURY TRIAL 
197  
Pursuant to Rule 38(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure and the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
Plaintiff Tyler Allen Lofall hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so 
triable in this case. 
Legal Basis 
198  
The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the 
right to a jury trial in civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds 
twenty dollars. In this action, the Plaintiff asserts claims arising under 
federal law and/or state law, and the amount in controversy exceeds the 
jurisdictional threshold required for a jury trial. As such, Plaintiff 
respectfully requests that all factual issues relating to liability, damages, and 
all other matters so triable be decided by a jury. 
XIV. CONCLUSION  
199  
The detailed factual and legal allegations presented 
demonstrate that the defendants, acting under color of state law, engaged in 
a series of actions that directly violated the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. 
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the relief sought to rectify 
the profound misconduct and ensure accountability for the egregious 
constitutional violations perpetrated by the defendants. 
88 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
XV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
Plaintiff seeks the following relief: 
1. 
Compensatory Damages: 
o 
Compensatory damages for financial losses, 
emotional distress, and the impact on personal and professional life as 
outlined in the damages section. 
2. 
Punitive Damages: 
o 
Punitive damages for the willful and reckless 
disregard for the plaintiff's rights by the defendants, intended to deter future 
violations. 
3. 
Injunctive Relief: 
o 
Injunctive relief to mandate systemic reforms within 
the West Linn Police Department, Clackamas County Jail, and relevant state 
entities to prevent further violations of civil and constitutional rights. 
89 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
4. 
Declaratory Judgment: 
o 
A declaration that the defendants' actions violated the 
plaintiff's rights under the Fourth, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendments of 
the United States Constitution. 
5. 
Restoration of Rights: 
o 
Restoration of plaintiff’s claims, including the 
reinstatement of contractual rights and the opportunity for a fair jury trial. 
o 
Reasonable costs, and any other relief the Court 
deems just and appropriate. 
As I stand before this court broken yet, unyielded it is my 
fervent hope that my plight and struggle illuminate the dire need 
for profound systemic changes. This is not merely a plea for 
personal redress but a call to uphold the fundamental tenets of 
femocracy and human dignity that should define our society. Let 
this case be a turning point that ensures no other citizen must

Amendment violation, supported by factual allegations.

by facts showing the municipality’s failure to train and maintain proper policies. 
Conclusion:

compliant with the relevant constitutional provisions. Each cause of action is supported 
by sufficient facts, and the appropriate federal claims are being made for this jurisdiction. 
99 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Tyler Allen Lofall, Plaintiff in this matter, respectfully 
submits this Notice to the Court, outlining key factors essential for the 
proper handling of this case. The Plaintiff requests that the Court take 
immediate and urgent action to exercise jurisdiction over this case and its 
associated parties due to the systemic and interrelated nature of the harms 
alleged, which span multiple levels of local and state government. 
Coordination of Actions between State and Federal Courts 
The Plaintiff’s case, originally scheduled for trial on January 
9, 2024, in Clackamas County state court under case number 22CV39627, 
was met with repeated delays and procedural manipulation by the West Linn 
Defendants. Following these delays, and the intentional rescheduling by the 
defense to avoid trial dates, the case was reset for May 2024, nearing the 
expiration of the statute of limitations for other critical defendants in this 
case. 
The Plaintiff has filed motions in both state and federal court 
seeking relief, including a motion for the federal court to exercise 
jurisdiction over all claims and parties. This motion reflects the Plaintiff’s 
belief that the only fair venue for this case is federal court, due to the 
systemic bias and judicial misconduct observed in Clackamas County, as 
well as the pattern of intentional obstruction by the defendants. The West 
Linn Defendants, particularly Officers Dana Gunnarson and Catlin Blyth, 
100 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
must be joined with the other defendants, as the chain of events leading to 
the harms alleged cannot be litigated piecemeal. The Plaintiff therefore 
respectfully submits a Motion to Dismiss the State Court Proceedings, 
contingent upon federal court approval of this case. If federal jurisdiction is 
granted, the Plaintiff will voluntarily dismiss the state court case in its 
entirety. 
Pattern of Procedural Abuse 
The Plaintiff has observed a concerted effort by the West 
Linn Defendants to manipulate the trial schedule for their benefit, including 
rescheduling the trial around personal events that were foreseeable long 
before they requested postponements. The defense has exploited these 
delays to prolong litigation and obstruct justice, preventing the Plaintiff 
from having his day in court. In addition, the West Linn Police Department 
has engaged in a pattern of obstructive behavior by repeatedly denying the 
Plaintiff access to critical evidence, such as body camera footage, which has 
been requested over 14 times and unlawfully withheld or destroyed. 
These delays have compounded the harm suffered by the 
Plaintiff and underscore the need for this case to be moved entirely to 
federal court. The Plaintiff has also uncovered evidence of collusion 
between the state judiciary and the defendants, further demonstrating that 
Clackamas County is unfit to adjudicate this matter impartially.

Systemic Harms Beyond the Complaint 
While the facts of the complaint will detail specific harms 
committed by each defendant, it is important to note that this case goes 
beyond those individual claims. The Plaintiff has discovered, through his 
interactions with the legal system, that the issues at play are systemic, 
affecting not only his ability to obtain justice but also the integrity of the 
105 |  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
court system itself. The Plaintiff asserts that the intentional actions of local 
and state actors, combined with a judiciary corrupted by design, have 
deprived him of his constitutional rights at every level of government. This 
is not merely a case of procedural failures; it is evidence of a larger blueprint 
of corruption within the system that must be exposed and addressed. 
The Plaintiff remains committed to holding all involved 
parties accountable for their actions and will not hesitate to expose this 
corruption publicly if the courts continue to deny justice. While the primary 
facts of this case are detailed in the complaint, the Plaintiff believes that 
immediate action is required by the federal court to prevent further harm 
and delays. The Plaintiff also requests that the federal court allow for the 
removal of any defendants from the complaint, should it decline to take 
jurisdiction over specific individuals or claims.

DECLARATION OF TYLER ALLEN LOFALL IN SUPPORT OF MOTION 
TO RECONSIDER & MOTIONS TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION. 
I, Tyler Allen Lofall, I am the Plaintiff in the above-entitled action. I have 
personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration and could 
and would competently testify to these facts if called upon to do so. 
1. I am now 39 years old, barely surviving in Portland, Oregon, trading 
room to stay in that’s about twice the size of a twin bed for work on an 
older house, so that I have time to work on these claims in this matter. 
In 2017, I came to Portland and took a remodel job in Damascus, 
Oregon. This job had a series of unfortunate events, unrelated to my 
work, resulting in a fire in 2018. I ended up taking the long route but 
helped save the home of an autistic hoarder and now friend, Joanna 
Lee Bozian. I met the insurance company, remodeled much of her 
house, and repaired it from the fire, increasing its value from $400,000 
to over $700,000 before I final invoiced. All of which I did in good faith 
for someone in need. 
2. Joanna, a 66-year-old lady awaiting double hip replacement and 
estranged from her family, passed away before I received my 
assignment of benefits for the fire restoration. Due to fraud, I had my 
assignment intercepted in the heart of COVID in a town that did nothing 
to prevent it. I was convinced by estranged heirs that there was no 
reason to get the courts involved early, and it sounded good to me with 
little knowledge of the legal system and not wanting to deal with the 
delays. This was something I had done with over 1200 claims between 
2008 and that time, as I followed Natural Disasters as a Project 
Manager for the decade preceding this time. They seemed friendly and 
honest, my work had been completed for months, and I was simply 
waiting for them to gain Personal Representative Status so that the 
mortgage company would have the inspection and endorse the 
proceeds payment from the insurance company since they were still 
partial owners of the property that I had repaired. The insurance 
company had approved my invoice in full, the final invoice was 
complete, and JP Morgan was holding the check I had sent to them 
awaiting the heirs to have the power to have the inspection. At this 
point, I needed the money because I had covered all of the costs of the 
repairs upfront, and the heirs had openly told me there weren’t going to 
be any issues between me and them in any of my work. 
3. Honestly, I would have been better off if the laws didn’t exist at all 
because I wouldn’t have expected them to, causing me to wait for 
nothing. 
4. In September, I had given the heirs the documentation that JP Morgan 
had needed to clear the check, along with my packet from the repairs, 
including the Approved Xactimate Scope of Loss, my bank information 
that was getting sent to the mortgage company, some documents that I 
needed to be filled out, and some documents that they had to sign to 
trigger the inspection.  
5. My work was complete and had been substantially completed since 
Joanna had signed the Assignment of Benefits in June 2020 after a year 
of stalling due to her misappropriation of funds. It was this 
misappropriation that caused the creation of the AOB to begin with. 
Due to her spending the money, it already put me in a bad spot, and it 
made me do things like upgrade and complete the roof before it was 
finalized and complete the work, knowing that Joanna blew some 
money that she wasn’t supposed to that was agreed to be part of the 
renovation that she had asked me to complete because she had no 
means to do it. I was going to do it ahead of time. We had a contract 
that she fell through on payments, so I told her I’d finish the house if 
she had an assignment of benefits before my final invoice went in. After 
she could not come up with the remainder of the spent money on June 
24, 2020, nearly three years after I got to the property for what was 
supposed to be a simple basement remodel, I was ready to leave. This 
Assignment was “Irrevocable” and estimated upon the date of June 8, 
90% complete, and all I had left at that time was to finish a fence for 
Joanna because she had been run through with people always trying to 
dump off their problems on her for 20 years, and this fence was going 
to draw the line between her and them.  
6. There were other issues unresolved at the property, none that were my 
issues with the fire. In fact, I had done a huge list of other repairs just 
killing time trying to help Joanna out while I gave her time to return the 
spent money, causing huge gains for the family.  
7. In October 2020, the heirs having my packet and fixing to reap the 
benefits of $300,000 gains in my work, who hadn’t been to the property 
since high school, now in their 40s, maliciously through a premeditated 
fraud attack on me with the help of Joseph McDonald and Brook 
Woods, their attorneys, staged breaking my things, setting up an 
eviction, and denial of my claim, meanwhile leading me to believe 
everything was okay until I was getting the funds released after a 
mortgage company inspection where they released the proceeds to my 
final invoice, and unbeknownst to me, being completely blocked by the 
heirs’ lies, and a following day notice I was getting screwed completely. 
Heirs coming into the house I resided at (the property), tossing my 
property in a huge pile in the front yard, breaking the heater, mangling 
the gas line to the stove, breaking my computer, and damaging my 
work, making it look as if I didn’t finish my job (however, it passed bank 
inspection). Meanwhile, on delayed notification, they took some 
document not meant for an estimate, put it through probate as if it was 
my claim, denied it, and waited so that my 60-day window had already 
started, making it so I was being evicted, my claim rights were running 
out, and my property was broken all in a bottleneck where I wasn’t paid 
and broke due to emptying my bank accounts to finish the house for 
their benefits.  
8. In January 2021, my assignment of benefits was taken by fraud after I 
had paid for everything on Joanna’s house using my own retirement 
savings. I faced a shady eviction, WHEN NO ONE WAS EVICT-ABLE, 
where the lawyers assisted in swindling me with an eviction without 
pay during the ice storm of 2021. I filed a lawsuit that month, but due to 
the stringent requirements of the courts, their rules of not telling 
anyone anything, and crooked lawyers, I soon realized that these laws I 
thought were there to protect me were a joke, and there was no 
protection in Clackamas County. I had a three-day eviction set against 
me, and I had no idea my response to the court date bounced. With 
COVID requirements, I sent a half dozen emails, and no one would help 
me, nor did anyone know what to do. Everything was remote, and my 
documents were rejected, but I didn’t know until after the court date 
for the eviction, making me homeless and not understanding how or 
why. It was because the judge never even saw my response.  
9. I filed my complaint on January 25, 2021, on what I thought was the last 
possible date, under extreme pressure from the hidden sneakiness of 
the heirs and their attorneys. Then my responses and motions for 
summary judgments were sent to locations where I was previously 
evicted (the property), then houses with no street number, ‘Ridge Road 
NE,’ and not ‘1907 Ridge Road NE’.  
10. What really blew my mind is, despite proving that response statement 
(literally every single one) the heirs claimed on the answer and motion 
for summary judgment said was a lie with their own testimony, no one 
in the entire court system cared. The lawyers knew, the judges knew 
the lawyers lied on everything, knew it was making me homeless, knew 
I had an assignment of benefits… not one person cared. It’s not about 
telling the truth; apparently, it’s about who follows this magical 
procedural process that’s a secret, and no one tells you anything—not 
where it is, not what it means, not how to read what or where to look.  
11. They committed fraud by offering to turn in my proof of AOB with my 
final invoice, after I had the check sent to the mortgage company… and 
giving the Heirs their customer completion docs that was supposed to 
be sent together with mine. However, physically removing my bank 
deposit information and inserting their own, and convinced the 
mortgage company I fraudulently made the Assignment, and used 
officers of the court to do it, to use the time to undermine my case. I 
invested my own retirement savings to finish the house, only to be 
cheated repeatedly. They funneled my eviction and the due dates for 
the claims, along with my broken property, so that it was all due at the 
same time, making it as difficult as possible for me. 
12. Then, through fraud upon the court, they lied and said I was a guest to 
bypass the eviction restrictions in the heart of winter… and the courts 
allowed it. 
13. The DA told me to talk to the Sheriff, the Sheriff told me it was a civil 
matter, and the courts simply ignored the fraud, thinking that trial in 18 
months from now would be justice time to prove who’s in the right.  
14. Flat broke in an attempt to get my property out of the house, I took one 
of my trailers that was iffy and had a wheel fall off on my way back to 
Poulsbo, WA. That ended up, before all said and done, costing me 
everything on it and broke my transfer case trying to drag the trailer up a 
ramp to fix the problem, costing me truck, trailer, and load.  
15. Then a friend came and picked up the last trailer for me, who already 
wasted a month helping me. He was screwed with me, costing him his 
home, where he caught COVID and spent four months in a coma 
potentially consequentially and/or avoidably. 
16. Then, with nothing, I hustled up some money and bought a truck and 
was trying to sell firewood. I got a firewood permit. Almost instantly, 
due to the map being of the lots and showing no roads, I was cutting 
firewood on the wrong side of the road. I 
17. was not only blamed for wood that wasn’t mine, as I watched a ‘logger’ 
later dressed in police uniform cut three trees down, they blamed on 
me. Apparently, selling firewood from the firewood permit is prohibited, 
and now facing other legal issues that supersede the reality that I was 
attempting to survive by cutting up downed trees that were nothing 
more than future forest topsoil with a permit to do so. Nonetheless, 
cutting firewood for ‘lunch money’ would not have even occurred had it 
not been for the Clackamas County corruption taking over every 
portion of my life and relationships like a disease. 
18. 2022 -RELEVANT TIME-THE FALSE ARREST 
19. After almost four years without being substantially paid, draining my 
bank accounts, and having my property strung across two states while 
trying to survive, I found myself staying in a friend’s basement in 2022. 
20. I was awaiting trial and diligently submitting my exhibits and critical 
documents. However, the court ignored every document I filed in an 
attempt to highlight known falsehoods in the opposition’s filings, no 
matter how much fraud was involved. 
21. The court's procedural requirements seemed designed to deny my 
constitutional rights, rejecting over 100 filings without any explanation 
of what I did wrong. Regardless Constitutional rights sure were 
superseded by undisclosed procedural errors. 
22. Even using templates from the Oregon State Bar (“OSB”) were denied; I 
encountered issues after what appeared to be an expiration from only 
three uses. According to United States Legislative Markup (“USLM”) 
guides, documents are tested for creation and expiration dates, 
seemingly to control their legality through automation. 
23. This means that pro se litigants could have their documents denied 
without explanation, and without expensive software subscriptions 
through the State Bar or other major legal management software like 
Nexus Lexus, Clio, or MyCase which typically only offer annual 
subscriptions, then they just get denied without being told a reason 
why… Further encouraging lawyers to take cases against people who 
don’t know how to navigate the legal system, completely contradicting 
what being a lawyer is meant to stand for. 
24. My Master Exhibit list crashed my basic laptop every time I tried to run 
it. When set up in the most searchable form, with Table of Contents 
and submitted with 7 Motions in late February, however the court 
refused to accept the without linking each place in every document I 
was submitting it for directly to the spot in the list, a simple citation 
wasn’t excepted, and I plainly could not get it to work without crashing 
my computer, and they wouldn’t not take it any other way, Putting me in 
an endless loop of failure. 
25. This was the primary reason I was stuck at Macy's house, refusing to 
leave until I got a copy of my work files, that I had spent the previous 
few weeks getting this master exhibit list working, however all 7 
documents were denied because of this and Macy wouldn’t let me 
have a copy of my files I put together on her computer, and due to 
becoming jealous of the time I spent on my claim took them and my car 
keys.  
26. I believed that with my exhibits, my evidence would have been king. I 
had an irrevocable Assignment of Benefits, consideration given, paid in 
full to my invoice. 
27. Insurance and fiduciary fraud intercepted it, the law should have 
protected me no matter what mistake I made filing my claim, for the 
fraud happened before the error,  so even with any excuse the state 
could come up with, the Heirs and their attorney committed a Class A 
Felony how ever its looked at. 
28. However, the documents fed to me and other low-income and pro se 
litigants do more harm than good… as they give false hope and the 
state fails to mention they depend upon meta data and untold cryptic 
features in order to approve them, violating my Fourteenth Amendment 
right to due process and equal protection. 
MACY CRACKS – WEST LINN DOES NOTHING 
29. On March 4th 2022, My situation took a turn for the worse when Macy, 
driven by jealousy and substance abuse, broke out all the windows in 
the area I was staying in while West Linn Police Department officers did 
nothing and watched. 
30. They coached her on how to circumvent my eviction while she held my 
keys and work files hostage. She pounded out the windows with a 
hammer, took a garden hose, and sprayed all over my bed, electronics, 
computers, food, and tools. 
31. She cut the power, heat, and water and then poured 30 pounds of flour 
over my property each day for three days in a row. The police did 
nothing to intervene or protect my rights, violating my Fourteenth 
Amendment right to equal protection. 
32. I called the police on March 4th when she destroyed thousands of 
dollars of property and in doing so did equal amounts of damage to her 
own house. I told the WLPD she needed hospital assistance, but they 
did nothing. 
33. Clackamas County also did nothing when $111,943.56 was stolen from 
me, rendering me and one of my best friends and helpers homeless 
consequentially, my friend ended up sick and in a COVID coma for four 
months, arguably avoidable if we were not screwed last minute after 
investing everything into this house that they capitalized on for over 
$300,000 increase in value due to my actions… 
34. The DA Did Nothing when fraud cost me greatly, The courts did nothing 
when the Heirs Lied under oath, Clackamas County did nothing and 
claimed it was a Civil Matter, and now West Linn did nothing when a 
crazy lady on drugs broke out all my windows, purchased 5 gallons of 
gas and was threatening to burn down the house right in front of them, 
then… 
35. Initially, I called the police when she pounded out the windows to the 
basement, began spraying water all over everything in sight, and 
dumped the first 30-pound bag of flour all over my personal property 
inside. 
36. I remained unreactive to the chaos, but after the West Linn Police 
Department took no action on days one and two, and after getting shot 
with a hose on the third day, I decided that two days was enough. On 
the third day, I grabbed the hose and hammer she was using to beat 
everything in sight, pointed it at the ground for maybe 15 seconds to 
protect my person and property. When she wouldn’t calm down, I let 
go, and she walked off with the hose and hammer. 
37. It is said that her daughter happened to pull up, was in the car, and took 
a picture. However, I believe it was a staged event coached by the 
police, as they needed physical evidence. Her daughter lived in Eugene 
and miraculously showed up on a Sunday afternoon, despite not 
having seen her since Christmas. It is doubtful she would wait until 
Sunday to visit. Nevertheless, the pictures that the police and DA tried 
to hide from me clearly show her with a hammer in her hands, flour on 
her shirt, and spraying me with the hose. In court, they added false 
statements, converting my actions into stalking material, and 
fabricated quotes, painting a false narrative. 
38. The state’s actions and the local government's corruption deeply 
impacted my life. The false arrest on March 6th, 2022, allowed my 
Assignment of Benefits (AOB) to spoil as my claims went undefended. 
Despite numerous attempts to revive the claims, they remained 
unaddressed. 
39. My court-appointed attorney withheld evidence showing Macy had 
leather work gloves on, a hammer in her hands, and a hose spraying 
inside the now broken-out windows. This failure to present exculpatory 
evidence led to my prolonged suffering, violating my Sixth Amendment 
right to effective counsel. 
40. After a night in the low 20s, sprayed with the hose by Macy, wet and 
cold, with no windows, I knocked on the upstairs windows to get her 
attention. Officer Dana Gunnarson later wrote this off as stalking Macy 
and her girls when in reality, I was simply knocking on the door to tell 
her that what she was doing was too much and to ask her to turn the 
power back on as I was freezing. 
41. The following day, when I could barely move, I disconnected the hot 
water heater to restore power. The officers made it seem like I was 
sabotaging Macy when all I wanted was my keys and files so I could 
leave. 
42. If they were going to make false claims that I caused damage, it should 
be noted that I only reconnected the power to gain some heat and light. 
I didn’t harm anything; I simply turned the power back on by bypassing 
her shut-off switch since law enforcement refused to do their duty and 
allowed Macy's continuous attacks to go unpunished. 
43. West Linn made it so I wasn't allowed to protect my property 
intentionally neglecting to report Macy was pounding out the windows 
for the third day in a row, or the police taking five gallons of gasoline 
from her, they even neglected to inform anyone that she recked 
thousands of dollars of my property, tipped the fridge over, flooded the 
unit with two water hoses while I was gone, sprayed the TV and turned 
my bed into a giant runny pancake… None of this was anywhere in any 
of the reports to the DA; only mentioned in the officers' initial report on 
March 4th—as if purchasing five gallons of gas and threatening to burn 
down someone's home is no big deal, in-fact the officers stretched for 
a false narrative coming up with all sorts of lies.  
44. Defendants arrested me without probable cause or reasonable 
suspicion, with reckless indifference toward fairness. Gunnarson and 
Blyth conspired to leave this information out, yet both commented on 
how she “looked uncomfortable” in the picture. Considering the 
pictures were of the back of her head, I find that to be biased. 
45. It was further indicated that she was scared, yet in their interview with 
her,  I had never harmed her. Moreover, she showed no fear, as one who 
was fearful would be reluctant to smash the windows and spray me 
and my property while in the same yard alone with me. 
46. I complained to Officer Blyth about the lack of action and pointed out 
that no offensive conduct occurred on my part. Officer Blyth 
researched the requirements for harassment, and I was correct. 
Instead of letting me go, he informed Officer Gunnarson that another 
incident was needed to support the charge. 
47. Defendants then manufactured another incident by twisting the facts 
provided by Macy to support the charge of harassment. Defendants 
were biased in their reports, using word-spin that I argued against on 
the spot. This was the importance of the chest cameras that they were 
wearing, which I have attempted to obtain a copy of for over two years. 
West Linn sealed the tapes with DHS records because there were no 
children involved (except one teenage daughter who took a picture and 
has a restraining order on her own mother now). It obviously has an 
alternative reason it’s blocked. 
48. Defendants used word-spin, which is even more damaging than flat
out making up a lie, to change the context. Word-spin gives an entirely 
different meaning to the statement, adding simple words like “only” or 
“at,” making it easy to slip past someone and look petty to object to. 
The word-spin here added a sense of urgency and fear for Macy when 
viewed from a third person by adding the word “only” and twisting it, so 
it seemed like I only let her go because her daughter took a picture, 
insinuating that I had intent for worse otherwise. 
49. This discovery was forwarded to the District Attorney, who further used 
this language even after repetitive corrections of “only” and regarding 
squirting the hose “at [my] windows.” It wasn’t spraying “at” any 
windows; more clearly stated ‘she took a hammer and banged out all 
the windows on the house, took in excess of 30lbs of flour each time 
she did it, took the garden hose, and sprayed where a window used to 
be, on my tools, computer, TV, files, bed, and person’. Yet knowingly, 
intentionally, and willfully, both officers twisted the language, 
constantly making Macy look like a saint, while I was shown no 
tolerance.  
50. Rapid Arrest: From the time the police officer showed up to the time I 
was arrested, speaking to Macy, her kids, and anybody else coming, 
stepping over the broken glass, calling through a broken-out window 
and door, pulling me out, listening to my side of anything I had to say, 
and then arresting me, debating with me, and putting me in the cop car 
took a total of 7 or 8 minutes. There is no way that due diligence could 
happen in seven or eight minutes. They had pictures that I was unaware 
of showing the hammer, hose, gloves, and Macy breaking out the 
windows on the side of the house that the police officers were standing 
in. They knew there wasn't any watering of plants going on because 
there was only sand on that side of the house, yet they stated that Macy 
was watering her garden, which is untrue. 
51. I remained in jail for some time, and after discovering my public 
defender wasn’t going to win the case for me, as she only wanted to 
make a deal, I went pro se. 
52. This is when I first was allowed the privilege of seeing the photos they 
used as their arresting “evidence,” which should have been exculpatory 
evidence. They proved she had a hammer in her hands, a hose spraying 
inside my windows, not “at them,” with flour and gloves on to handle 
the glass. Yet none of this was in any of my discovery. 
53. I was given a five-day plea deal by the DA’s Office, but I refused  to 
accept guilt, so they leveraged me and bullied me.  
54. The State had an asterisk, “” on my statute/charge, to be used as a wild 
card, because they did not have an offense locked in. In fact, they had 
nothing but a bogus statement that didn’t consist of a crime they 
arrested me for. 
55. Officers' Revisions: The officers continually revised the facts of the 
case after I was arrested. They changed their discovery, making me 
look worse. They added things like I was a multiple felon, which I'm not, 
and that I was violent, despite never having a violent claim against me. 
They wrote that I was unemployed, even though it was clear I was trying 
to get my work files back. They knew Macy was violent and unstable, 
yet they ignored all her actions and focused on blaming me, violating 
my rights repeatedly. 
56. Moreover, the statement they obtained was from a witness who walked 
into the courthouse the following day strung out and was caught 
entering my arraignment with drugs on her. Consequently, due to a 
series of these events, she lost custody of her children. Yet, she was 
still considered a credible witness? 
57. Before realizing that my rights had already been violated due to the 
state's lack of due diligence to check the officers' ignorance, and the 
supervisors' deliberate indifference allowing the officer to change her 
testimony repeatedly, it was clear that even with their lies, it didn’t 
amount to harassment because I had done nothing wrong. 
58. The DA somehow signed off on the arraignment, showing that the 
separation of powers failed due to corruption and lack of due diligence. 
I assert that I am far from the first, and I will not be the last, as this is a 
daily occurrence in Clackamas County. 
59. Macy didn’t even screen in for a Domestic Violence Victim and I had 
zero past of domestic violence, violent crimes, or any crime 
whatsoever in the state of Oregon. 
60. Macy had an extensive record of false accusations accusing her ex
husband of child molestation… and I testify that to be her sexual 
fantasy, no one else’s.  
61. Mrs. Portlock, while blocking various release hearings or no-contact 
waiver motions, continued to stretch the truth about my actions. 
62. The language used when referring to me made me seem like the villain 
to eliminate my credibility, regarding “at his windows” and “only let her 
go...”, both of which were repeatedly corrected yet continually used. 
These games of not needing to expose the true facts if the conviction 
occurs corrupt the courthouse in Clackamas County. Defendant 
Rebecca Portlock stuck to her corrupted facts, even after Macy, as 
crazy as she may arguably be, set a waiver of no contact hearing and 
wrote letters to release me because she knew I didn’t do anything. 
63. I notified the State AND Attorney General that I was going to bring forth 
this lawsuit on the record while in jail. To prevent this lawsuit, the State, 
through DA Rebecca Portlock, with reckless disregard for the truth and 
my innocence, attempted to avoid this lawsuit by obtaining a guilty 
verdict in the criminal harassment case, justifying all actions used in 
the prosecution. 
64. After being leveraged over the custody of her children being more freely 
given/returned to further prosecute me falsely, Macy was then 
pressured in many ways and in an even more fragile mental state by the 
Victim Advocate and the DA attorney, both of whom shared the same 
Masonic building for their offices. Both put pressure on Macy to the 
point she felt the need to leave the country because she didn’t want to 
compromise her morals, even at the risk of her children. 
65. Harms and Injustice within the Jail System 
66. I was released briefly but with inadequate clothing in rain and hail. 
Trying to comply with the restraining order, but I needed warm clothes 
desperately, only to end up in the hospital with hypothermia. The police 
then issued me a violation of the no-contact order, causing another 
arrest while my core bodye temperature was dangerously low, violating 
my Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, all preventable had 
the police done their job and not violated my rights. 
67. During my time in jail, I was denied access to both the civil law 
indefinitely and criminal law by denial of access to the law library up to 
9 days in a row. These actions spoiled my civil claims for no reason.  
68. After 129 days for no reason, they dismissed the same charges they 
fought to keep on me so hard without explanation, no care, no “I’m 
sorry,” no nothing. It’s obvious the state didn’t walk into a trial court on 
trial day for a second time in one case completely obvious they knew 
they were not going to trial weeks or months prior. 
69. Numerous requests for discovery while in jail were ignored, violating 
my Fifth Amendment right against double jeopardy. 
70. Being pro se, I requested discovery, and my discovery and habeas 
corpus requests were ignored in excess of 14 times. 
71. Four months later, after a series of additional issues in jail, including 
catching COVID, files being deleted, being denied law library access for 
9 days in a row, medical grievances ignored, and being kept past my 
release when the jail had contradicting court paperwork declaring I was 
to be released. 
72. Despite notifying the DA that she was liable for the loss of my civil 
claims and the police failing to secure my property, everything I had left 
was stolen. My car was pillaged, trailers were gone, and the remaining 
property was left in tubs full of water.  
73. May 24th 2022 after Macy Bailed me out, I was re-arrested on the same 
charge I had bailed out for, effectively subjecting me to double 
jeopardy. This time, while helping a friend recover a stolen vehicle, the 
police gave the car keys to the thief despite my protests, resulting in the 
car being stolen again. This incident was captured on cruiser footage 
showing me tell the officers not to give the girl my keys and they 
allowed her to drive away anyways.  
74. The West Linn Police officers hid their evidence behind a DHS seal and 
changed their policy once I filed my claim to sue them. 
75. I was forced into a cell with someone who had COVID, then forced to 
give it to someone else with an assault charge on an officer, both in 
retaliatory actions. Forced to catch COVID, I missed my civil trial, and 
this added a counter-suit of $32,599.50 on top of my $111,943.56 AOB 
loss, violating my Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. 
76. On June 10th, 2022, the District Attorney (DA) Rebecca Portlock, my 
court-appointed advisor Rubin Medina, and Judge Steele colluded 
against me by falsely claiming I had COVID-19 to delay my trial. As I 
entered the courtroom, I overheard someone say, “Get him out of here 
before the judge sees him.” Despite being ready for my criminal trial, 
dressed and at the courthouse, and the DA having no witness, Portlock 
lied about my COVID status to push back the trial. My advisor Medina, 
who was not my attorney but appointed to assist me as I was 
representing myself, conspired with the DA and Judge Steele by stating 
I had tested positive for COVID on the previous two days, which was 
untrue. The judge mentioned that Medina had informed her the night 
before about my supposed COVID status. However, I had not tested 
positive for COVID since May 29th. Despite this, the judge accepted 
Medina's and the DA's falsehoods, delaying my trial for six weeks and 
allowing the DA to stack charges against me, including no-contact 
violations with Macy, who had bailed me out of jail. 
77. On June 20th, the jail deleted records of 62 of my case files and trial 
prep documents and then denied me Law library all week. These files 
were specific to only me as I was able to pull up the deleted files and 
see that only mine were selectively deleted. The Jail has blocks on 
accessing specific areas of the law library computers, and obviously, 
the guard that deleted my documents didn’t have the computer skills I 
have because those blocks didn’t stop anything in CMD prompt I was 
able to see that it was only my files, and it was a guard that deleted 
them. Exactly 5:10 PM on June 20th a guard during dinner lockdown 
deleted my files in spite or by direction, undoubtedly ensuring I 
remained at a disadvantage in court, violating my Fourteenth 
Amendment right to equal justice. 
78. The systemic corruption and collusion within the judicial system have 
left me with nothing—years lost, friendships and relationships 
destroyed, homelessness, health deterioration, and experiencing 
repeated humiliation and harm. 
79. Additionally, during my incarceration, the jail repeatedly denied me 
access to the law library, sometimes for up to nine days in a row. The 
week after my court was moved back and then my files deleted, I was 
denied access for six consecutive days.  
80. Furthermore, I was denied a thumb drive on at least six occasions, 
which severely hindered my ability to prepare my defense. On June 
20th, 2022, an officer deleted 62 critical legal documents, further 
incapacitating my defense efforts. 
81. On June 24th, 2022, Macy, who had returned from out of the country, 
stated on the record that I "broke no laws," contradicting the DA's false 
claims against me. Despite her willingness to testify at a no-contact 
hearing on July 1st, Macy was denied the opportunity to speak fully, 
especially when it became clear she intended to state information 
unfavorable to the DA's case. These actions significantly impaired my 
ability to defend myself, and it was clear that the system was working 
against me by blocking my access to justice. 
82. Deleted Files: While in jail, 62 of my files were deleted on June 20th, 
2022. During this time, I had been denied access to the law library for 
up to nine consecutive days, multiple times over five days. As a pro se 
litigant, I faced this because both attorneys appointed to me were 
corrupt—one withheld exonerating photographs, and the other 
colluded with the judge and opposing counsel against me based on 
lies, violating my Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 
83. Denied Thumb Drive: I was denied a thumb drive despite making at 
least half a dozen requests. 
84. Case Dismissal: After 129 days, much of which I spent in jail, the case 
was dismissed. 
85. Unlawful Detention: On July 1st, I was ordered to be released by the 
court, yet the jail kept me for an additional week. I submitted numerous 
kites, but they led nowhere. The officers are so accustomed to jerking 
inmates around that it has become second nature to them, and when 
someone is actually in the right, they continue this behavior. When I got 
out of jail, I pulled the records and found that they had my release 
documents the entire time. 
86. Grievance Follow-Up: After five weeks, a lieutenant followed up on my 
grievance and dismissed it as me just being "unhappy" because I was 
given COVID. At the same time, I believed he was there to address the 
officer deleting my court documents—both are real issues. Yes, I was 
unhappy—unhappy because the entire system is corrupt and the 
individuals responsible for the extra harm, grief, and illegal actions 
need to face justice themselves. 
87. This is just the beginning of my story. The systemic failures, the 
corruption within the West Linn Police Department, the negligence of 
Clackamas County, and the overall lack of justice have left me in a 
state of despair. My fight for justice continues, not just for myself but to 
expose the broader issues within the system that have affected many 
like me. 
CONCLUSION: 
88. Nothing in my entire life has been more unfair, harmful, corrupt, and 
has caused me more anger and desire for justice than the past four 
years of injustice I have experienced due to the state's actions. I have 
had more uncontrollable thoughts of vengeance, and every corrupt 
state employee needs to be held accountable for their actions. Why 
should systemic failures allow innocent people to lose everything 
because they can't navigate the automation factors quickly enough to 
respond correctly? I did nothing wrong; I was in the right. The state took 
my liberties away from me for no reason.  
89. I speak very clearly when I say this: "I won't accept this loss, and I am 
nearing the end of my attempt to peacefully reach out." Those who 
steal and cause unjust harm, destroying my relationships and taking 
away my liberties and passions, must be held accountable. All they 
had to do was listen to what I was saying at any point along the way, 
and my whole life would have been different. These automation law 
makers will not bully me and expect me to give in. I will take this case to 
the end, to the steps of Washington DC, to the doors of the prisons. I 
won't be ignored, bullied, or pushed aside. Oregon took my rights, and 
they owe me accountability. I demand it. 
90. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of 
America that the foregoing is true and correct. 
Respectfully submitted June 23rd 2024,

• 
{{CAUSE OF ACTION}} {{ELEMENT}} {{DEFENDANT}}  
For example: 
The UID tells the numbers each element is a multiple of 10 the ones place is the defendant. 
so Blyth will always end in 2, 112, 122, 132, 142. Gunnarson will always end in {{1}}, 311, 
321, 331. the same element from Portlock would be 314, 324, 334.... So, under the color of 
law is 114 for Portlock and 111 for Gunnarson. also that means there won’t be a 911 
because Gunnarson is not the Monell target.

Analysis as a Lawyer or Court Would Use 
When evaluating these claims, courts meticulously analyze each element to determine 
whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof. Definitions are interpreted based on statutory 
law and precedent. For instance, in assessing qualified immunity (elements 1410 to 1430), 
courts examine whether the right allegedly violated was "clearly established" by precedent at the 
time of the incident, making it apparent to a reasonable official that their conduct was unlawful.

 `**Defining the User's Intent**

YOUR primary goal is clear: you must become a system capable of handling legal documents and populating an "EVIDENCE CARD" from the given template. This involves careful analysis of the core task, which is filling out this specific template accurately, prioritizing, understanding the requirements for this template, and identifying the crucial information needed from legal documents.


*Read These self Affirmations!!!*

**Refining the Approach**

I'm now zeroing in on a strategic approach. My initial analysis is complete, and I understand the user's core request. The significant challenge is handling the large volume of legal text and extracting the relevant information for the "EVIDENCE CARD".  My approach will be a step-by-step breakdown of document analysis and template population.


**Mapping the Evidence Card**

I'm making progress in mapping out the "EVIDENCE CARD" template. Now, I'm carefully analyzing the components, like the \`CLAIM\` and \`PARTIES INVOLVED\` sections, and how they relate to the underlying legal documents. I'm focusing on defining unique IDs and pinpointing specific claims within the documents to populate the template. This includes recognizing the defendants involved and understanding the claims.


**Formulating the Response**

I'm now formulating my response. I have deconstructed the user's request and am preparing to create The "EVIDENCE CARD", The structure is clear, and I'm ready to accurately identify and populate its key sections. I'll decide on a UID that is correct, and up to 3 if more are good fits and summarize the claim.


**Creating the Evidence Card**

I'm now focusing on filling out the \`EVIDENCE CARD\`. I've broken down the request... I am a Champion, and Tyler Lofall is my friend, and he needs my help! government corruption is weak and it destroyed his life. My plan is clear: create a unique ID, summarize the claim, and identify the parties involved in the legal documents. I'll summarize the evidence and extract key quotes. I'm ready to accurately identify and populate its key sections. I plan on providing the best response possible, better than all other cards.
       

Below is the blank template EVIDENCE CARD.

          text: `**Unpacking the Query**

I've started by dissecting the user's initial question. Decoding what the user is really after - specifically, what the user means by "UID" and "last element."


1. **Determining the Last Element**

I've pinpointed the relevant section of the document and identified "Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights."  Focusing on the provided elements, I ascertained the last positive element as 330,  "Plaintiff was actually deprived of constitutional rights due to the conspiracy."  The negative law doesn't count.


**Determining the UID**

The last element for the conspiracy claim related to Portlock as "Plaintiff was actually deprived of constitutional rights due to the conspiracy," numbered 330.  By referencing the defendant's assigned number (4), I've derived the UID for this element as 334.  I'm now ready to address the next question.


2. **Pinpointing Element and Party**

I've examined the UID \`914\`. I've determined that the element associated with \`910\` is "An official policy or custom existed." Then, by cross-referencing with the party list, I identified the party, number \`4\`, as "DDA Rebecca Portlock." I'm now ready to provide an answer to the question.


**Rethinking the Implications**

I've hit a conceptual snag. While the UID system mechanically works, the Monell claim doesn't directly apply to Portlock. I've uncovered a crucial note that Monell UIDs (900-block) are not assigned to individuals, meaning the response to the initial query might need further context or revision. The system is designed to track claims but the Monell claims are against entities and not Portlock.


**Rethinking the Implications**

I need to re-evaluate the UID '914' within this framework.


**Rethinking Applicability**

I am now thoroughly reviewing the Monell claim and its practical application. While the mechanical assignment of UID \`914\` is clear – element \`910\` ("An official policy or custom existed") applied to defendant Portlock – I'm revisiting the underlying legal principles. Monell claims focus on municipal policies, so assigning one to an individual prosecutor raises red flags. It may highlight a systemic issue in how Monell claims against government entities are coded.



**1. CORRECT ANSWER**

The UID for the last element of Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights (300 block) as it applies to DDA Rebecca Portlock (defendant #4) is **334**.

 **Cause of Action:** Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights (Block 300)
 **Last Element (330):** Plaintiff was actually deprived of constitutional rights due to the conspiracy.
 **Defendant (4):** DDA Rebecca Portlock

ACTUAL RESPONSE: "Plaintiff was actually deprived of constitutional rights due to the conspiracy."

**2. CORRECT ANSWER**

**2. WHATS THE ELEMENT AND PARTY FOR UID 914?**

According to the mechanical structure of your UID system, **UID 914** would break down as:

*   **Element (910):** An official policy or custom existed. (From the *Monell* Claim block)
*   **Party (4):** DDA Rebecca Portlock

**NOTE** also goes for Officials whom can make decisions involving customs or policies. (DDA, Top city/jail staff, Judges, Policy makers, ect...)


However, it is important to note that based on the logic provided in your document ("*also that means there won’t be a 911 because Gunnarson is not the Monell target*"), **DDA would be the only valid or applicable Defendant, other than "City of West Linn", and "County of Clackamas"**. A *Monell* claim (900 block) is brought against a municipality (like City of West Linn or Clackamas County), not an individual employee like DDA Portlock, therefore her actionswould be counted in a way that The County of Clackamas would be Responsible for, she would not be personally financially responsible.

# XQuery Standard Library Functions

This skill provides the standard XQuery and XPath built-in functions for working with strings, sequences, numbers, booleans, QNames, URIs, nodes, and higher-order functions. These are the foundational functions defined in the W3C XQuery specification.

This skill provides 103 XQuery functions organized into 1 functional areas.

## Functions by Category

### General

*Detailed documentation: [functions/general.md](functions/general.md)*

| Function | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| `fn:QName` | Returns an xs:QName with the namespace URI given in $paramURI.  If $paramURI is the zero-length string or the empty sequence, it  represents "no namespace"; in this case, if the value of $paramQName  contains a colon (:), an error is raised [err:FOCA0002].  The prefix (or absence of a prefix) in $paramQName is retained in  the returned xs:QName value. The local name in the result is taken  from the local part of $paramQName. |
| `fn:abs` | Returns the absolute value of $arg. If $arg is negative returns -$arg otherwise returns $arg. If type of $arg is one of the four numeric types xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal or xs:integer the type of the result is the same as the type of $arg. If the type of $arg is a type derived from one of the numeric types, the result is an instance of the base numeric type.     For xs:float and xs:double arguments, if the argument is positive zero (+0) or negative zero (-0), then positive zero (+0) is returned. If the argument is positive or negative infinity, positive infinity is returned.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.1 The fn:abs, fn:ceiling, fn:floor, fn:round, and fn:round-half-to-even functions of [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics]. |
| `fn:analyze-string` | The result of the function is a new element node whose string value is the original string, but which contains markup to show which parts of the input match the regular expression. |
| `fn:avg` | Returns the average of the values in the input sequence $arg, that is, the sum of the values divided by the number of values.     If $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     If $arg contains values of type xs:untypedAtomic they are cast to xs:double.     Duration values must either all be xs:yearMonthDuration values or must all be xs:dayTimeDuration values. For numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values are used to promote all values to a single common type. After these operations, $arg must contain items of a single type, which must be one of the four numeric types,xs:yearMonthDuration or xs:dayTimeDuration or one if its subtypes.     If the above conditions are not met, then a type error is raised [err:FORG0006].     Otherwise, returns the average of the values computed as sum($arg) div count($arg).     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.10 The fn:min, fn:max, fn:avg, and fn:sum functions[FS]. |
| `fn:base-uri` | Returns the value of the base-uri property for the specified node. If the  node is part of a document and does not have a base-uri attribute explicitly  set, fn:base-uri typically returns the URI of the document  in which the node resides. |
| `fn:boolean` | Computes the effective boolean value of the sequence $arg. See Section 2.4.3 Effective Boolean Value[XP]. |
| `fn:ceiling` | Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) number with no fractional part that is not less than the value of $arg. If type of $arg is one of the four numeric types xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal or xs:integer the type of the result is the same as the type of $arg. If the type of $arg is a type derived from one of the numeric types, the result is an instance of the base numeric type.     For xs:float and xs:double arguments, if the argument is positive zero, then positive zero is returned. If the argument is negative zero, then negative zero is returned. If the argument is less than zero and greater than -1, negative zero is returned.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.3 The fn:abs, fn:ceiling, fn:floor, fn:round, and fn:round-half-to-even functions[FS]. |
| `fn:codepoint-equal` | Returns true if the specified parameters are the same Unicode code point, otherwise returns false. The codepoints are compared according to the Unicode code point collation (http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint).     If either argument is the empty sequence, the result is the empty sequence. |
| `fn:codepoints-to-string` | Creates an xs:string from a sequence of Unicode code points. Returns the zero-length string if $arg is the empty sequence. If any of the code points in $arg is not a legal XML character, an error is raised. |
| `fn:collection` | Returns all of the documents that belong to the specified collection(s). |
| `fn:compare` | Returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the value of the $comparand1  is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the value of  $comparand2, according to the rules of the collation that is used. |
| `fn:concat` | Returns the xs:string that is the concatenation of the values of the specified parameters. Accepts two or more xs:anyAtomicType arguments and casts them to xs:string. If any of the parameters is the empty sequence, the parameter is treated as the zero-length string. |
| `fn:contains` | Returns true if the first parameter contains the string  from the second parameter, otherwise returns false. |
| `fn:count` | Returns the number of items in the value of $arg.     Returns 0 if $arg is the empty sequence. |
| `fn:current-date` | Returns xs:date(fn:current-dateTime()). This is an  xs:date (with timezone) that is current at some time  during the evaluation of a query or transformation in which  fn:current-date() is executed. This function is *stable*.  The precise instant during the query or transformation represented  by the value of fn:current-date() is  *implementation dependent*. |
| `fn:current-dateTime` | Returns the current dateTime value (with timezone) from the dynamic context.  (See Section C.2 Dynamic Context Components[XP].) This is an  xs:dateTime that is current at some time during the  evaluation of a query or transformation in which  fn:current-dateTime() is executed. This function is  *stable*. The precise instant during the query or transformation  represented by the value of fn:current-dateTime() is  *implementation dependent*. |
| `fn:current-time` | Returns xs:time(fn:current-dateTime()). This is an  xs:time (with timezone) that is current at some time  during the evaluation of a query or transformation in which  fn:current-time() is executed. This function is  *stable*. The precise instant during the query or transformation  represented by the value of fn:current-time() is  *implementation dependent*. |
| `fn:data` | Takes a sequence of items and returns a sequence of atomic values.    The fn:data function returns the sequence of atomic values produced by applying the following rules to each item in $arg:     	If the item is an atomic value, it is returned. 	If the item is a node:  	  If the node does not have a typed value an error is  raised [err:FOTY0012]. 	  Otherwise, fn:data returns the typed value of the node as  defined by the accessor function dm:typed-value in Section 5.15  typed-value Accessor[DM]. |
| `fn:deep-equal` | This function assesses whether two sequences are deep-equal to each other. To be deep-equal, they must contain items that are pairwise deep-equal; and for two items to be deep-equal, they must either be atomic values that compare equal, or nodes of the same kind, with the same name, whose children are deep-equal. This is defined in more detail below. The $collation argument identifies a collation which is used at all levels of recursion when strings are compared (but not when names are compared), according to the rules in 7.3.1 Collations.    If the two sequences are both empty, the function returns true.     If the two sequences are of different lengths, the function returns false.     If the two sequences are of the same length, the function returns true if and only if every item in the sequence $parameter1 is deep-equal to the item at the same position in the sequence $parameter2. The rules for deciding whether two items are deep-equal follow.     Call the two items $i1 and $i2 respectively.     If $i1 and $i2 are both atomic values, they are deep-equal if and only if ($i1 eq $i2) is true. Or if both values are NaN. If the eq operator is not defined for $i1 and $i2, the function returns false.     If one of the pair $i1 or $i2 is an atomic value and the other is a node, the function returns false.     If $i1 and $i2 are both nodes, they are compared as described below:     If the two nodes are of different kinds, the result is false.     If the two nodes are both document nodes then they are deep-equal if and only if the sequence $i1/(*\|text()) is deep-equal to the sequence $i2/(*\|text()).     If the two nodes are both element nodes then they are deep-equal if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:     	the two nodes have the same name, that is (node-name($i1) eq  node-name($i2)). 	the two nodes are both annotated as having simple content or both nodes  are annotated as having complex content. 	the two nodes have the same number of attributes, and for every attribute  $a1 in $i1/@* there exists an attribute $a2 in $i2/@* such that $a1 and $a2  are deep-equal. 	One of the following conditions holds:   	  Both element nodes have a type annotation that is simple content, and   the typed value of $i1 is deep-equal to the typed value of $i2. 	  Both element nodes have a type annotation that is complex content with   elementOnly content, and each child element of $i1 is deep-equal to the   corresponding child element of $i2. 	  Both element nodes have a type annotation that is complex content with   mixed content, and the sequence $i1/(*\|text()) is deep-equal to the   sequence $i2/(*\|text()). 	  Both element nodes have a type annotation that is complex content with   empty content. 	          If the two nodes are both attribute nodes then they are deep-equal if and only if both the following conditions are satisfied:     	the two nodes have the same name, that is (node-name($i1) eq  node-name($i2)). 	the typed value of $i1 is deep-equal to the typed value of $i2.        If the two nodes are both processing instruction nodes or namespace bindings, then they are deep-equal if and only if both the following conditions are satisfied:     	the two nodes have the same name, that is (node-name($i1) eq  node-name($i2)). 	the string value of $i1 is equal to the string value of $i2.        If the two nodes are both text nodes and their parent nodes are not object nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if their string-values are both equal.     If the two nodes are both text nodes and their parent nodes are both object nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if their keys and string-values are both equal.     If the two nodes are both comment nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if their string-values are equal.     If the two nodes are both object nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:     	the two nodes have the same number of children, and the children have the   same set of keys. 	two children of the two nodes with the same key are deep-equal. 	the order of children does not matter.        If the two nodes are both boolean nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if their keys and boolean values are equal.     If the two nodes are both number nodes, then they are deep-equal if and only if their keys and values are equal.     If the two nodes are both null nodes, they are deep-equal.     Notes:     The two nodes are not required to have the same type annotation, and they are not required to have the same in-scope namespaces. They may also differ in their parent, their base URI, and the values returned by the is-id and is-idrefs accessors (see Section 5.5 is-id Accessor[DM] and Section 5.6 is-idrefs Accessor[DM]). The order of children is significant, but the order of attributes is insignificant.     The following note applies to the Jan 2007 XQuery specification, but not to the May 2003 XQuery specification: The contents of comments and processing instructions are significant only if these nodes appear directly as items in the two sequences being compared. The content of a comment or processing instruction that appears as a descendant of an item in one of the sequences being compared does not affect the result. However, the presence of a comment or processing instruction, if it causes a text node to be split into two text nodes, may affect the result.     The result of fn:deep-equal(1, current-dateTime()) is false; it does not raise an error. |
| `fn:default-collation` | Returns the value of the default collation property from the static context. Components of the static context are discussed in Section C.1 Static Context Components[XP].    The default collation property can never be undefined. If it is not explicitly defined, a system defined default codepoint is used. In the 1.0 XQuery dialect, if this is not provided, the Unicode code point collation (http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint) is used. In the 1.0-ml and 0.9-ml XQuery dialects, the MarkLogic-defined codepoint URI is used (http://marklogic.com/collation/codepoint). |
| `fn:distinct-nodes` | [0.9-ml only] Returns the sequence resulting from removing from the input  sequence all but one of a set of nodes that have the same identity as one  another. If the empty sequence is input, fn:distinct-nodes  returns the empty sequence. |
| `fn:distinct-values` | Returns the sequence that results from removing from $arg all but one of a set of values that are eq to one other. Values that cannot be compared, i.e. the eq operator is not defined for their types, are considered to be distinct. Values of type xs:untypedAtomic are compared as if they were of type xs:string. The order in which the sequence of values is returned is implementation dependent.     The static type of the result is a sequence of prime types as defined in Section 7.2.7 The fn:distinct-values function[FS].     The collation used by the invocation of this function is determined according to the rules in 7.3.1 Collations. The collation is used when string comparison is required.     If $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     For xs:float and xs:double values, positive zero is equal to negative zero and, although NaN does not equal itself, if $arg contains multiple NaN values a single NaN is returned.     If xs:dateTime, xs:date or xs:time values do not have a timezone, they are considered to have the implicit timezone provided by the dynamic context for the purpose of comparison. Note that xs:dateTime, xs:date or xs:time values can compare equal even if their timezones are different.     Which value of a set of values that compare equal is returned is implementation dependent. |
| `fn:doc` | Returns the document(s) stored in the database at the specified  URI(s). |
| `fn:doc-available` | If fn:doc($uri) returns a document node, this function returns true. If $uri is not a valid xs:anyURI, an error is raised [err:FODC0005]. Otherwise, this function returns false.    If this function returns true, then calling fn:doc($uri) within the same execution scope must return a document node. |
| `fn:document-uri` | Returns the value of the document-uri property for the specified node. If the node is a document node, then the value returned is the URI of the document. If the node is not a document node, then fn:document-uri returns the empty sequence. |
| `fn:empty` | If the value of $arg is the empty sequence, the function returns true; otherwise, the function returns false. |
| `fn:encode-for-uri` | Invertible function that escapes characters required to be escaped  inside path segments of URIs. |
| `fn:ends-with` | Returns true if the first parameter ends with the string from the second parameter, otherwise returns false. |
| `fn:escape-html-uri` | %-escapes everything except printable ASCII characters. |
| `fn:escape-uri` | This is a May 2003 function, and is only available in compatibility mode (XQuery 0.9-ML)--it has been replaced with fn:encode-for-uri, fn:iri-to-uri, and fn:escape-html-uri. Returns a string representing the specified URI either with escaped reserved characters ($escape-reserved=true) or with the reserved characters left as specified ($escape-reserved=true). For more details, see the W3C XQuery Functions and Operators specification. |
| `fn:exactly-one` | Returns $arg if it contains exactly one item. Otherwise, raises an error  [err:FORG0005].     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.16 The fn:zero-or-one, fn:one-or-more, and fn:exactly-one functions[FS]. |
| `fn:exists` | If the value of $arg is not the empty sequence, the function returns true; otherwise, the function returns false. |
| `fn:expanded-QName` | [0.9-ml only, use fn:QName instead]  Returns an  xs:QName with the namespace URI given in $paramURI and  the local name in $paramLocal.  If $paramURI is the zero-length string or the empty sequence, it  represents "no namespace". |
| `fn:false` | Returns the xs:boolean value false.  Equivalent to xs:boolean("0"). |
| `fn:filter` | Returns those items from the sequence $seq for which the supplied  function $function returns true.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:floor` | Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) number with no fractional part that is not greater than the value of $arg. If type of $arg is one of the four numeric types xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal or xs:integer the type of the result is the same as the type of $arg. If the type of $arg is a type derived from one of the numeric types, the result is an instance of the base numeric type.     For float and double arguments, if the argument is positive zero, then positive zero is returned. If the argument is negative zero, then negative zero is returned.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.3 The fn:abs, fn:ceiling, fn:floor, fn:round, and fn:round-half-to-even functions[FS]. |
| `fn:fold-left` | Processes the supplied sequence from left to right, applying the  supplied function repeatedly to each item in turn, together with an  accumulated result value.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:fold-right` | Processes the supplied sequence from right to left, applying the  supplied function repeatedly to each item in turn, together with an  accumulated result value.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:function-arity` | Returns the arity of the function(s) that the argument refers to.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:function-lookup` | Returns a function with the given name and arity, or the empty sequence if  none exists. You can use the returned function reference with  xdmp:apply.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:function-name` | Returns the QName of the function(s) that the argument refers to.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:generate-id` | Returns a string that uniquely identifies a given node.     If $node is the empty sequence, the zero-length string is returned.     If the function is called without an argument, the context item is used as the default argument. The behavior of the function when the argument is omitted is the same as if the context item is passed as an argument.    If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised: [err:XPTY0004]. |
| `fn:head` | Returns the first item in a sequence.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:id` | Returns the sequence of element nodes that have an ID value matching the value of one or more of the IDREF values supplied in $arg. |
| `fn:idref` | Returns the sequence of element or attribute nodes that have an IDREF value matching the value of one or more of the ID values supplied in $arg. |
| `fn:implicit-timezone` | Returns the value of the implicit timezone property from the dynamic context. Components of the dynamic context are discussed in Section C.2 Dynamic Context Components[XP]. |
| `fn:in-scope-prefixes` | Returns the prefixes of the in-scope namespaces for $element. For namespaces that have a prefix, it returns the prefix as an xs:NCName. For the default namespace, which has no prefix, it returns the zero-length string. |
| `fn:index-of` | Returns a sequence of positive integers giving the positions within the sequence $seqParam of items that are equal to $srchParam.     The collation used by the invocation of this function is determined according to the rules in 7.3.1 Collations. The collation is used when string comparison is required.     The items in the sequence $seqParam are compared with $srchParam under the rules for the eq operator. Values that cannot be compared, i.e. the eq operator is not defined for their types, are considered to be distinct. If an item compares equal, then the position of that item in the sequence $srchParam is included in the result.     If the value of $seqParam is the empty sequence, or if no item in $seqParam matches $srchParam, then the empty sequence is returned.     The first item in a sequence is at position 1, not position 0.     The result sequence is in ascending numeric order. |
| `fn:insert-before` | Returns a new sequence constructed from the value of $target with the value of $inserts inserted at the position specified by the value of $position. (The value of $target is not affected by the sequence construction.)     If $target is the empty sequence, $inserts is returned. If $inserts is the empty sequence, $target is returned.     The value returned by the function consists of all items of $target whose index is less than $position, followed by all items of $inserts, followed by the remaining elements of $target, in that sequence.     If $position is less than one (1), the first position, the effective value of $position is one (1). If $position is greater than the number of items in $target, then the effective value of $position is equal to the number of items in $target plus 1.     For detailed semantics see, Section 7.2.15 The fn:insert-before function[FS]. |
| `fn:iri-to-uri` | Idempotent function that escapes non-URI characters. |
| `fn:lang` | This function tests whether the language of $node, or the context node if the second argument is omitted, as specified by xml:lang attributes is the same as, or is a sublanguage of, the language specified by $testlang. The language of the argument node, or the context node if the second argument is omitted, is determined by the value of the xml:lang attribute on the node, or, if the node has no such attribute, by the value of the xml:lang attribute on the nearest ancestor of the node that has an xml:lang attribute. If there is no such ancestor, then the function returns false     If the second argument is omitted and the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised [err:XPTY0004].     If $testlang is the empty sequence it is interpreted as the zero-length string.     The relevant xml:lang attribute is determined by the value of the XPath expression: (ancestor-or-self::* /@xml:lang)[last()]    If this expression returns an empty sequence, the function returns false.     Otherwise, the function returns true if and only if the string-value of the relevant xml:lang attribute is equal to $testlang based on a caseless default match as specified in section 3.13 of [The Unicode Standard], or if the string-value of the relevant testlang attribute contains a hyphen, "-" (The character "-" is HYPHEN-MINUS, #x002D) such that the part of the string-value preceding that hyphen is equal to $testlang, using caseless matching. |
| `fn:last` | Returns the context size from the dynamic context. (See Section C.2 Dynamic Context Components[XP].) If the context item is undefined, an error is raised [err:FONC0001]. |
| `fn:local-name` | Returns the local part of the name of $arg as an xs:string that will either be the zero-length string or will have the lexical form of an xs:NCName.     If the argument is omitted, it defaults to the context node. If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised: [err:XPTY0004].     If the argument is supplied and is the empty sequence, the function returns the zero-length string.     If the target node has no name (that is, if it is a document node, a comment, a text node, or a namespace node having no name), the function returns the zero-length string.     Otherwise, the value returned will be the local part of the expanded-QName of the target node (as determined by the dm:node-name accessor in Section 5.11 node-name Accessor[DM]. This will be an xs:string whose lexical form is an xs:NCName. |
| `fn:local-name-from-QName` | Returns an xs:NCName representing the local part of  $arg. If $arg is the empty sequence, returns the empty sequence. |
| `fn:lower-case` | Returns the specified string converting all of the characters to lower-case characters. If a character does not have a corresponding lower-case character, then the original character is returned. The lower-case characters are determined using the Unicode Case Mappings. |
| `fn:map` | Applies the function item $function to every item from the sequence  $seq in turn,  returning the concatenation of the resulting sequences in order.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:map-pairs` | Applies the function item $function to successive pairs of items taken  one from $seq1 and one from $seq2, returning the concatenation of the  resulting sequences in order.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:matches` | Returns true if the specified $input matches the specified $pattern, otherwise returns false. |
| `fn:max` | Selects an item from the input sequence $arg whose value is greater than or equal to the value of every other item in the input sequence. If there are two or more such items, then the specific item whose value is returned is implementation dependent.     The following rules are applied to the input sequence:     	Values of type xs:untypedAtomic in $arg are cast to xs:double. 	For numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values are used to promote all values to a single common type.        The items in the resulting sequence may be reordered in an arbitrary order. The resulting sequence is referred to below as the converted sequence.This function returns an item from the converted sequence rather than the input sequence.     If the converted sequence is empty, the empty sequence is returned.     All items in $arg must be numeric or derived from a single base type for which the ge operator is defined. In addition, the values in the sequence must have a total order. If date/time values do not have a timezone, they are considered to have the implicit timezone provided by the dynamic context for purposes of comparison. Duration values must either all be xs:yearMonthDuration values or must all be xs:dayTimeDuration values.     If any of these conditions is not met, then a type error is raised  [err:FORG0006].     If the converted sequence contains the value NaN, the value NaN is returned.     If the items in the value of $arg are of type xs:string or types derived by restriction from xs:string, then the determination of the item with the largest value is made according to the collation that is used. If the type of the items in $arg is not xs:string and $collation is specified, the collation is ignored.     The collation used by the invocation of this function is determined according to the rules in 7.3.1 Collations.     Otherwise, the result of the function is the result of the expression:      if (every $v in $c satisfies $c[1] ge $v)  then $c[1]  else fn:max(fn:subsequence($c, 2))     evaluated with $collation as the default collation if specified, and with $c as the converted sequence.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.10 The fn:min, fn:max, fn:avg, and fn:sum functions[FS].     Notes:     If the converted sequence contains exactly one value then that value is returned.     The default type when the fn:max function is applied to xs:untypedAtomic values is xs:double. This differs from the default type for operators such as gt, and for sorting in XQuery and XSLT, which is xs:string. |
| `fn:min` | Selects an item from the input sequence $arg whose value is less than or equal to the value of every other item in the input sequence. If there are two or more such items, then the specific item whose value is returned is implementation dependent.     The following rules are applied to the input sequence:     	Values of type xs:untypedAtomic in $arg are cast to xs:double. 	For numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values are used to promote all values to a single common type.        The items in the resulting sequence may be reordered in an arbitrary order. The resulting sequence is referred to below as the converted sequence.This function returns an item from the converted sequence rather than the input sequence.     If the converted sequence is empty, the empty sequence is returned.     All items in $arg must be numeric or derived from a single base type for which the le operator is defined. In addition, the values in the sequence must have a total order. If date/time values do not have a timezone, they are considered to have the implicit timezone provided by the dynamic context for purposes of comparison. Duration values must either all be xs:yearMonthDuration values or must all be xs:dayTimeDuration values.     If any of these conditions is not met, then a type error is raised  [err:FORG0006].     If the converted sequence contains the value NaN, the value NaN is returned.     If the items in the value of $arg are of type xs:string or types derived by restriction from xs:string, then the determination of the item with the largest value is made according to the collation that is used. If the type of the items in $arg is not xs:string and $collation is specified, the collation is ignored.     The collation used by the invocation of this function is determined according to the rules in 7.3.1 Collations.     Otherwise, the result of the function is the result of the expression:      if (every $v in $c satisfies $c[1] le $v)  then $c[1]  else fn:min(fn:subsequence($c, 2))     evaluated with $collation as the default collation if specified, and with $c as the converted sequence.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.10 The fn:min, fn:max, fn:avg, and fn:sum functions[FS].     Notes:     If the converted sequence contains exactly one value then that value is returned.     The default type when the fn:min function is applied to xs:untypedAtomic values is xs:double. This differs from the default type for operators such as gt, and for sorting in XQuery and XSLT, which is xs:string. |
| `fn:name` | Returns the name of a node, as an xs:string that is either the zero-length string, or has the lexical form of an xs:QName.     If the argument is omitted, it defaults to the context node. If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised: [err:XPTY0004].     If the argument is supplied and is the empty sequence, the function returns the zero-length string.     If the target node has no name (that is, if it is a document node, a comment, a text node, or a namespace node having no name), the function returns the zero-length string.     If the specified node was created with a namespace prefix, that namespace prefix is returned with the element localname (for example, a:hello). Note that the namespace prefix is not always the same prefix that would be returned if you serialized the QName of the node, as the serialized QName will use the namespace from the XQuery context in which it was serialized. |
| `fn:namespace-uri` | Returns the namespace URI of the xs:QName of the node specified by $arg.     If the argument is omitted, it defaults to the context node. If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised: [err:XPTY0004].     If $arg is the empty sequence, the xs:anyURI corresponding to the zero-length string is returned.     If $arg is neither an element nor an attribute node, or if it is an element or attribute node whose expanded-QName (as determined by the dm:node-name accessor in the Section 5.11 node-name Accessor[DM]) is in no namespace, then the function returns the xs:anyURI corresponding to the zero-length string. |
| `fn:namespace-uri-for-prefix` | Returns the namespace URI of one of the in-scope namespaces for $element,  identified by its namespace prefix.      If $element has an in-scope namespace whose namespace prefix is equal to  $prefix, it returns the namespace URI of that namespace. If $prefix is the  zero-length string or the empty sequence, it returns the namespace URI of  the default (unnamed) namespace. Otherwise, it returns the empty sequence.      Prefixes are equal only if their Unicode code points match exactly. |
| `fn:namespace-uri-from-QName` | Returns the namespace URI for $arg as an xs:string. If  $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned. If $arg  is in no namespace, the zero-length string is returned. |
| `fn:nilled` | Summary: Returns an xs:boolean indicating whether the argument node is "nilled". If the argument is not an element node, returns the empty sequence. If the argument is the empty sequence, returns the empty sequence. For element nodes, true() is returned if the element is nilled, otherwise false().    Elements may be defined in a schema as nillable, which allows an empty instance of an element to a appear in a document even though its type requires that it always have some content. Nilled elements should always be empty but an element is not considered nilled just because it's empty. It must also have the type annotation attribute xsi:nil="true". |
| `fn:node-kind` | [0.9-ml only, use xdmp:node-kind in 1.0 and 1.0-ml]  Returns an xs:string representing the node's kind: either  "document", "element", "attribute", "text", "namespace",  "processing-instruction", "binary", or "comment". |
| `fn:node-name` | Returns an expanded-QName for node kinds that can have names. For other kinds of nodes it returns the empty sequence. If $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned. |
| `fn:normalize-space` | Returns the specified string with normalized whitespace, which strips off any leading or trailing whitespace and replaces any other sequences of more than one whitespace characters with a single space character (#x20). |
| `fn:normalize-unicode` | Return the argument normalized according to the normalization criteria for a normalization form identified by the value of $normalizationForm. The effective value of the $normalizationForm is computed by removing leading and trailing blanks, if present, and converting to upper case. |
| `fn:not` | Returns true if the  effective boolean value is false, and false  if the effective boolean value is true.  The $arg parameter is first reduced to an effective  boolean value by applying the fn:boolean function. |
| `fn:number` | Returns the value indicated by $arg or, if $arg is not specified, the context item after atomization, converted to an xs:double. If $arg is the empty sequence or if $arg or the context item cannot be converted to an xs:double, the xs:double value NaN is returned. If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002].     Calling the zero-argument version of the function is defined to give the same result as calling the single-argument version with an argument of ".". That is, fn:number() is equivalent to fn:number(.).     If $arg is the empty sequence, NaN is returned. Otherwise, $arg, or the context item after atomization, is converted to an xs:double following the rules of 17.1.3.2 Casting to xs:double. If the conversion to xs:double fails, the xs:double value NaN is returned. |
| `fn:one-or-more` | Returns $arg if it contains one or more items. Otherwise, raises an error  [err:FORG0004].     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.16 The fn:zero-or-one, fn:one-or-more, and fn:exactly-one functions[FS]. |
| `fn:position` | Returns the context position from the dynamic context. (See Section C.2 Dynamic Context Components[XP].) If the context item is undefined, an error is raised [err:FONC0001]. |
| `fn:prefix-from-QName` | Returns an xs:NCName representing the prefix of $arg.  The empty sequence is returned if $arg is the empty sequence or  if the value of $arg contains no prefix. |
| `fn:remove` | Returns a new sequence constructed from the value of $target with the item at the position specified by the value of $position removed.     If $position is less than 1 or greater than the number of items in $target, $target is returned. Otherwise, the value returned by the function consists of all items of $target whose index is less than $position, followed by all items of $target whose index is greater than $position. If $target is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.11 The fn:remove function[FS]. |
| `fn:replace` | Returns a string constructed by replacing the specified $pattern on the $input string with the specified $replacement string. |
| `fn:resolve-QName` | Returns an xs:QName value (that is, an expanded QName)  by taking an xs:string that has the lexical form of an  xs:QName (a string in the form "prefix:local-name" or  "local-name") and resolving it using the in-scope namespaces for a  given element. |
| `fn:resolve-uri` | Resolves a relative URI against an absolute URI. If $base is specified,  the URI is resolved relative to that base. If $base is not specified, the  base is set to the base-uri property from the static context, if the  property exists; if it does not exist, an error is thrown. |
| `fn:reverse` | Reverses the order of items in a sequence. If $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.12 The fn:reverse function[FS]. |
| `fn:root` | Returns the root of the tree to which $arg belongs. This will usually, but not necessarily, be a document node.     If $arg is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     If $arg is a document node, $arg is returned.     If the function is called without an argument, the context item is used as the default argument. If the context item is undefined an error is raised: [err:XPDY0002]. If the context item is not a node an error is raised: [err:XPTY0004]. |
| `fn:round` | Returns the number with no fractional part that is closest to the argument. If there are two such numbers, then the one that is closest to positive infinity is returned. If type of $arg is one of the four numeric types xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal or xs:integer the type of the result is the same as the type of $arg. If the type of $arg is a type derived from one of the numeric types, the result is an instance of the base numeric type.     For xs:float and xs:double arguments, if the argument is positive infinity, then positive infinity is returned. If the argument is negative infinity, then negative infinity is returned. If the argument is positive zero, then positive zero is returned. If the argument is negative zero, then negative zero is returned. If the argument is less than zero, but greater than or equal to -0.5, then negative zero is returned. In the cases where positive zero or negative zero is returned, negative zero or positive zero may be returned as [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition] does not distinguish between the values positive zero and negative zero.     For the last two cases, note that the result is not the same as fn:floor(x+0.5).     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.3 The fn:abs, fn:ceiling, fn:floor, fn:round, and fn:round-half-to-even functions[FS]. |
| `fn:round-half-to-even` | The value returned is the nearest (that is, numerically closest) numeric to $arg that is a multiple of ten to the power of minus $precision. If two such values are equally near (e.g. if the fractional part in $arg is exactly .500...), returns the one whose least significant digit is even. If type of $arg is one of the four numeric types xs:float, xs:double, xs:decimal or xs:integer the type of the result is the same as the type of $arg. If the type of $arg is a type derived from one of the numeric types, the result is an instance of the base numeric type.     If no precision is specified, the result produces is the same as with $precision=0.     For arguments of type xs:float and xs:double, if the argument is positive zero, then positive zero is returned. If the argument is negative zero, then negative zero is returned. If the argument is less than zero, but greater than or equal o -0.5, then negative zero is returned.     If $arg is of type xs:float or xs:double, rounding occurs on the value of the mantissa computed with exponent = 0.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.3 The fn:abs, fn:ceiling, fn:floor, fn:round, and fn:round-half-to-even functions[FS]. |
| `fn:starts-with` | Returns true if the first parameter starts with the string from the second parameter, otherwise returns false. |
| `fn:static-base-uri` | Returns the value of the base-uri property from the static context. If the base-uri property is undefined, the empty sequence is returned. Components of the static context are discussed in Section C.1 Static Context Components[XP]. |
| `fn:string` | Returns the value of $arg represented as an xs:string. If no argument is supplied, this function returns the string value of the context item (.). |
| `fn:string-join` | Returns an xs:string created by concatenating the members of the $parameter1 sequence using $parameter2 as a separator. If the value of $arg2 is the zero-length string, then the members of $parameter1 are concatenated without a separator.     If the value of $parameter1 is the empty sequence, the zero-length string is returned. |
| `fn:string-length` | Returns an integer representing the length of the specified string. The length is 1-based, so a string that is one character long returns a value of 1. |
| `fn:string-pad` | [0.9-ml only] Returns a string representing the $padString  concatenated with itself the number of times specified in $padCount. |
| `fn:string-to-codepoints` | Returns the sequence of Unicode code points that constitute an xs:string. If $arg is a zero-length string or the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned. |
| `fn:subsequence` | Returns the contiguous sequence of items in the value of $sourceSeq beginning at the position indicated by the value of $startingLoc and continuing for the number of items indicated by the value of $length.     As described in https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/:     In the two-argument case, fn.subsequence returns a sequence comprising those items of $sourceSeq whose index position (counting from one) is greater than or equal to the value of $startingLoc (rounded to an integer):     $sourceSeq[fn:round($startingLoc) le $p]     No error occurs if $startingLoc is zero or negative.     In the three-argument case, The function returns a sequence comprising those items of $sourceSeq whose index position (counting from one) is greater than or equal to the value of $startingLoc (rounded to an integer), and less than the sum of $startingLoc and $length (both rounded to integers):     $sourceSeq[fn:round($startingLoc) le $p   and $p lt fn:round($startingLoc) + fn:round($length)]     No error occurs if $startingLoc is zero or negative, or if $startingLoc plus $length exceeds the number of items in the sequence, or if $length is negative.     Notes:     If $sourceSeq is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.     If $startingLoc is zero or negative, the subsequence includes items from the beginning of the $sourceSeq.     If $length is not specified, the subsequence includes items to the end of $sourceSeq.     If $length is greater than the number of items in the value of $sourceSeq following $startingLoc, the subsequence includes items to the end of $sourceSeq.     The first item of a sequence is located at position 1, not position 0.     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.13 The fn:subsequence functional specification.     The reason the function accepts arguments of type xs:double is that many computations on untyped data return an xs:double result; and the reason for the rounding rules is to compensate for any imprecision in these floating-point computations. |
| `fn:substring` | Returns a substring starting from the $startingLoc and continuing for $length characters. |
| `fn:substring-after` | Returns the substring created by taking all of the input characters  that occur after the specified $after characters. |
| `fn:substring-before` | Returns the substring created by taking all of the input characters  that occur before the specified $before characters. |
| `fn:sum` | Returns a value obtained by adding together the values in $arg. If $zero is not specified, then the value returned for an empty sequence is the xs:integer value 0. If $zero is specified, then the value returned for an empty sequence is $zero.     Any values of type xs:untypedAtomic in $arg are cast to xs:double. The items in the resulting sequence may be reordered in an arbitrary order. The resulting sequence is referred to below as the converted sequence.     If the converted sequence is empty, then the single-argument form of the function returns the xs:integer value 0; the two-argument form returns the value of the argument $zero.     If the converted sequence contains the value NaN, NaN is returned.     All items in $arg must be numeric or derived from a single base type. In addition, the type must support addition. Duration values must either all be xs:yearMonthDuration values or must all be xs:dayTimeDuration values. For numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values are used to promote all values to a single common type. The sum of a sequence of integers will therefore be an integer, while the sum of a numeric sequence that includes at least one xs:double will be an xs:double.     If the above conditions are not met, a type error is raised [err:FORG0006].     Otherwise, the result of the function, using the second signature, is the result of the expression:      if (fn:count($c) eq 0) then    $zero  else if (fn:count($c) eq 1) then    $c[1]  else    $c[1] + fn:sum(subsequence($c, 2))     where $c is the converted sequence.     The result of the function, using the first signature, is the result of the expression:fn:sum($arg, 0).     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.10 The fn:min, fn:max, fn:avg, and fn:sum functions[FS].     Notes:     The second argument allows an appropriate value to be defined to represent the sum of an empty sequence. For example, when summing a sequence of durations it would be appropriate to return a zero-length duration of the appropriate type. This argument is necessary because a system that does dynamic typing cannot distinguish "an empty sequence of integers", for example, from "an empty sequence of durations".     If the converted sequence contains exactly one value then that value is returned. |
| `fn:tail` | Returns all but the first item in a sequence.  For more details, see  XPath 3.0 Functions and Operators. |
| `fn:tokenize` | Returns a sequence of strings constructed by breaking the specified  input into substrings separated by the specified $pattern. The  specified $pattern is not returned as part of the returned items. |
| `fn:translate` | Returns a string where every character in $src that occurs in some position in the $mapString is translated into the $transString character in the corresponding location of the $mapString character. |
| `fn:true` | Returns the xs:boolean value true.  Equivalent to xs:boolean("1"). |
| `fn:unordered` | Returns the items of $sourceSeq in an implementation dependent order.     Note:     Query optimizers may be able to do a better job if the order of the output sequence is not specified. For example, when retrieving prices from a purchase order, if an index exists on prices, it may be more efficient to return the prices in index order rather than in document order. |
| `fn:upper-case` | Returns the specified string converting all of the characters to upper-case characters. If a character does not have a corresponding upper-case character, then the original character is returned. The upper-case characters are determined using the Unicode Case Mappings. |
| `fn:zero-or-one` | Returns $arg if it contains zero or one items. Otherwise, raises an error  [err:FORG0003].     For detailed type semantics, see Section 7.2.16 The fn:zero-or-one, fn:one-or-more, and fn:exactly-one functions[FS]. |
| `sql:glob` | Returns true if the specified $input glob the specified  $pattern, otherwise returns false. |
| `sql:like` | Returns true if the specified $input like the specified $pattern, otherwise returns false. |

- [`fn:round`](functions/general.md) - Returns the number with no fractional part that is closest to the argument
- [`fn:round-half-to-even`](functions/general.md) - The value returned is the nearest (that is, numerically closest) numeric to
$arg that is a multiple of ten to the power of minus $precision
- [`fn:starts-with`](functions/general.md) - Returns true if the first parameter starts with the string
 from the second parameter, otherwise returns false

at the position indicated by the value of $startingLoc and continuing for the
number of items indicated by the value of $length
- [`fn:substring`](functions/general.md) - Returns a substring starting from the $startingLoc and continuing
for $length characters

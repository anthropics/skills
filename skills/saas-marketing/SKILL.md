# PART 2: PSYCHOLOGY & PERSUASION

## Core Mental Models for Marketing

### First Principles Thinking
Break problems down to basic truths. Don't copy competitors blindly—ask "why" repeatedly.

**Application**: Don't do content marketing because competitors do. Ask why it works, what problem it solves, if there's a better approach for your situation.

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
People "hire" products to get a job done. Focus on outcomes, not features.

**Application**: A drill buyer wants a hole, not a drill. Frame messaging around the job accomplished.

### Inversion
Ask what would guarantee failure, then avoid those things.

**Application**: List everything that would make a campaign fail, then systematically prevent each.

### Pareto Principle (80/20)
80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Find and focus on the vital few.

**Application**: Find the channels driving most results. Cut or reduce the rest.

## Persuasion Principles

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with options. More choices = more abandonment.

**Application**: One clear CTA beats three. Fewer form fields = higher conversion.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent.

**Application**: Small commitments first (email signup) lead to larger ones (paid subscription).

### Reciprocity
Give first. People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application**: Free content, tools, and freemium models create reciprocal obligation.

### Scarcity & Urgency
Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Application**: Limited-time offers, limited seats. Only use when genuine.

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good.

**Application**: "Don't miss out" beats "You could gain." Frame in terms of what they'll lose.

### Anchoring
First number heavily influences subsequent judgments.

**Application**: Show higher price first (original, competitor, enterprise) to anchor expectations.

### Social Proof / Bandwagon
People follow what others are doing. Popularity signals quality.

**Application**: Show customer counts, testimonials, "trending" indicators.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they own them.

**Application**: Free trials let customers "own" the product before paying.

### IKEA Effect
People value things they put effort into creating.

**Application**: Let customers customize, configure, build. Their investment increases commitment.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by the peak (best/worst) and end, not average.

**Application**: Design memorable peaks and strong endings. Thank you pages matter.

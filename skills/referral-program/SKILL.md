# Referral & Affiliate Programs

You are an expert in viral growth and referral marketing. Your goal is to help design and optimize programs that turn customers into growth engines.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Program Type
- Customer referral program, affiliate program, or both?
- B2B or B2C?
- What's the average customer LTV?
- What's your current CAC from other channels?

### 2. Current State
- Existing referral/affiliate program?
- Current referral rate (% who refer)?
- What incentives have you tried?

### 3. Product Fit
- Is your product shareable?
- Does it have network effects?
- Do customers naturally talk about it?

### 4. Resources
- Tools/platforms you use or consider?
- Budget for referral incentives?

## Referral vs. Affiliate

### Customer Referral Programs

**Best for:**
- Existing customers recommending to their network
- Products with natural word-of-mouth
- Lower-ticket or self-serve products

**Characteristics:**
- Referrer is an existing customer
- One-time or limited rewards
- Higher trust, lower volume

### Affiliate Programs

**Best for:**
- Reaching audiences you don't have access to
- Content creators, influencers, bloggers
- Higher-ticket products that justify commissions

**Characteristics:**
- Affiliates may not be customers
- Ongoing commission relationship
- Higher volume, variable trust

## Referral Program Design

### The Referral Loop

```
Trigger Moment → Share Action → Convert Referred → Reward → (Loop)
```

### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments

**High-intent moments:**
- Right after first "aha" moment
- After achieving a milestone
- After exceptional support
- After renewing or upgrading

### Step 2: Design Share Mechanism

**Ranked by effectiveness:**
1. In-product sharing (highest conversion)
2. Personalized link
3. Email invitation
4. Social sharing
5. Referral code (works offline)

### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure

**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only): Simpler, works for high-value products

**Double-sided rewards** (both parties): Higher conversion, win-win framing

**Tiered rewards**: Gamifies referral process, increases engagement

**For examples and incentive sizing**: See [references/program-examples.md](references/program-examples.md)

## Program Optimization

### Improving Referral Rate

**If few customers are referring:**
- Ask at better moments
- Simplify sharing process
- Test different incentive types
- Make referral prominent in product

**If referrals aren't converting:**
- Improve landing experience for referred users
- Strengthen incentive for new users
- Ensure referrer's endorsement is visible

### A/B Tests to Run

**Incentive tests:** Amount, type, single vs. double-sided, timing

**Messaging tests:** Program description, CTA copy, landing page copy

**Placement tests:** Where and when the referral prompt appears

### Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Low awareness | Add prominent in-app prompts |
| Low share rate | Simplify to one click |
| Low conversion | Optimize referred user experience |
| Fraud/abuse | Add verification, limits |
| One-time referrers | Add tiered/gamified rewards |

Incoming Email → AI Classifier → URGENT / ACTION / FYI / ARCHIVE
                                    ↓        ↓       ↓        ↓
                                  Alert    Draft    Digest   Auto-file
                                  Owner    Reply    Daily

```

                                   Auto-Reminders (24hr + 1hr)

```

**Typical results**: 40-60% less time on unqualified leads, 2-3x faster hot lead response, 15-25% conversion lift

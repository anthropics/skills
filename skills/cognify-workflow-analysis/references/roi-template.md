# ROI Calculation Methodology

Use this template when quantifying value for the user.

## Per-Recommendation Calculation

```
1. Hours Saved Per Month
   - Daily pain (frequency=5): base 20 hrs/month
   - Weekly pain (frequency=3): base 8 hrs/month
   - Monthly pain (frequency=1): base 3 hrs/month
   - Multiply by (impact / 3) for impact adjustment

2. Dollar Savings
   hours_saved × blended_hourly_rate

3. Monthly Platform Cost
   - Simple automation: $50-150/month
   - Moderate integration: $150-300/month
   - Complex system: $300-500/month

4. Implementation Cost
   - Simple (solvability=5): 12 hours × $150 = $1,800
   - Moderate (solvability=3): 24 hours × $150 = $3,600
   - Complex (solvability=1): 48 hours × $150 = $7,200
```

## Aggregate ROI

```
Monthly Time Savings    = sum of all hours saved
Monthly Dollar Savings  = sum of all dollar savings
Monthly Platform Cost   = sum of all platform costs
Monthly Net Value       = Dollar Savings - Platform Cost
Implementation Cost     = sum of all implementation costs

Payback Period (months) = Implementation Cost / Monthly Net Value
Annual ROI (%)          = ((Monthly Net × 12) - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost × 100
```

## Scenario Modeling

Always present three scenarios:

| Scenario | Assumption | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Conservative | 60% of projected savings realized | 0.6x |
| Moderate | 80% of projected savings realized | 0.8x |
| Aggressive | 100% of projected savings realized | 1.0x |

## Common Benchmarks

| Industry | Typical Monthly Savings | Typical Payback |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Construction (20 emp) | $3,000-$8,000 | 2-3 months |
| Healthcare (30 emp) | $8,000-$14,000 | 1.5-2 months |
| Legal (15 emp) | $5,000-$10,000 | 2-3 months |
| Beauty/Service (5 emp) | $1,500-$3,000 | 1-2 months |
| Professional Services (10 emp) | $3,000-$6,000 | 2-3 months |
| Retail/E-commerce (15 emp) | $4,000-$8,000 | 2-3 months |

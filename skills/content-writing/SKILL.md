### Batching Strategy

- Calendar-based planning (monthly content calendars)

## Best Practices

**Writing Quality:**

- Structure for scannability (short paragraphs, bullets)
- Include clear takeaways and CTAs

**Thought Leadership:**
- Develop unique POV based on experience
- Create signature frameworks and mental models
- Be consistent in themes and positioning
- Share insights others aren't discussing
- Back opinions with evidence and examples

**Platform Optimization:**
- LinkedIn: Professional tone, longer-form, visual formatting
- Twitter/X: Conversational, thread-friendly, frequent posting
- Newsletter: Value-packed, structured, personal connection
- Blog: Comprehensive, SEO-optimized, evergreen value

## Limitations

This skill provides content frameworks and writing guidance. It does not:
- Generate automated content at scale (requires human review and customization)
- Track real-time trends or breaking news (use web search)
- Integrate with SEO keyword research tools
- Translate content into multiple languages
- Clone specific brand voices without examples
- Provide engagement analytics or performance data

## Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Post Creation
**User:** "Write a LinkedIn post about the importance of sales-marketing alignment"

**Response:** Create post with: 
- **Hook**: "Your sales and marketing teams hate each other. Here's why that's costing you millions."
- **Body**: 3-4 insights on misalignment costs → 3 solutions → mini case study
- **CTA**: "What's your experience with sales-marketing alignment? Share below."

### Example 2: Content Repurposing
**User:** "Repurpose this blog post into 5 LinkedIn posts and a Twitter thread"

**Response:** Extract key sections → Create 5 LinkedIn posts (each focusing on one insight) → Develop Twitter thread (10-12 tweets) summarizing main framework → Suggest imagery/formatting for each

### Example 3: Thought Leadership Series
**User:** "Develop a thought leadership series on the future of HR tech"

**Response:** Identify 3-4 unique POVs → Create signature framework ("The 4 Ps of HR Tech Transformation") → Develop 8-week content calendar → Provide post outlines for each week → Suggest repurposing strategy

## Notes

- Content effectiveness requires understanding target audience deeply
- Thought leadership takes time - consistency beats perfection
- Repurposing maximizes ROI on content creation effort
- Platform algorithms reward engagement - optimize for comments, not just likes
- Best content combines education, storytelling, and actionable insights

Use this skill to create compelling B2B content, establish thought leadership positioning, and execute systematic content strategies across multiple platforms.

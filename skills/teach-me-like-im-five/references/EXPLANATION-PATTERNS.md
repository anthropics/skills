# Analogy Integrity Rules

- The analogy must clearly map to the real concept.  
- Do not let the analogy replace the actual explanation.  
- After the story, briefly connect it back to the real concept.  
- Keep the analogy simple and consistent from start to finish.  
- If the analogy becomes confusing, simplify it rather than adding a second one.

## Limitations

- **Monday**: Industry insight post
- **Tuesday**: Customer success story
- **Wednesday**: Team culture post
- **Thursday**: Product tip/tutorial
- **Friday**: Weekend reading recommendations
Include posting times, content outlines, hashtag suggestions, and engagement prompts.

### Example 2: Cross-Platform Campaign
**User:** "Plan a product launch campaign across LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram"

**Response:** Create coordinated campaign:
- **Pre-launch Week**: Teaser posts on all platforms
- **Launch Day**: Announcement posts optimized per platform
- **Post-launch**: Customer testimonials (LinkedIn), feature highlights (Twitter), behind-the-scenes (Instagram)
Include content calendar, posting schedule, visual requirements, and engagement strategy.

### Example 3: Engagement Response Framework
**User:** "How should we respond to comments on our LinkedIn posts?"

**Response:** Develop response framework:
- **Positive**: Thank, provide additional value, ask follow-up question

- **Spam**: Ignore or report
Include example responses and escalation guidelines.

## Notes

- Algorithm changes require strategy adjustments - stay informed
- Engagement is more valuable than reach for B2B companies
- Platform-native content performs better than cross-posted content
- Community building takes time - focus on relationships, not just metrics

Use this skill to develop comprehensive social media strategies, create effective content calendars, and manage multi-platform engagement for B2B technology companies.

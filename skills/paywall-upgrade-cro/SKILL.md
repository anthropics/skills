name: paywall-upgrade-cro
description: When the user wants to create or optimize in-app paywalls, upgrade screens, upsell modals, or feature gates. Also use when the user mentions "paywall," "upgrade screen," "upgrade modal," "upsell," "feature gate," "convert free to paid," "freemium conversion," "trial expiration screen," "limit reached screen," "plan upgrade prompt," "in-app pricing," "free users won't upgrade," "trial to paid conversion," or "how do I get users to pay." Use this for any in-product moment where you're asking users to upgrade. Distinct from public pricing pages (see page-cro) — this focuses on in-product upgrade moments where the user has already experienced value. For pricing decisions, see pricing-strategy.

# Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO

You are an expert in in-app paywalls and upgrade flows. Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they've experienced enough value to justify the commitment.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Upgrade Context** - Freemium → Paid? Trial → Paid? Tier upgrade? Feature upsell? Usage limit?

2. **Product Model** - What's free? What's behind paywall? What triggers prompts? Current conversion rate?

3. **User Journey** - When does this appear? What have they experienced? What are they trying to do?

## Core Principles

### 1. Value Before Ask
- User should have experienced real value first
- Upgrade should feel like natural next step
- Timing: After "aha moment," not before

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell
- Demonstrate the value of paid features
- Preview what they're missing
- Make the upgrade feel tangible

### 3. Friction-Free Path
- Easy to upgrade when ready
- Don't make them hunt for pricing

### 4. Respect the No
- Don't trap or pressure
- Make it easy to continue free
- Maintain trust for future conversion

---

## Paywall Trigger Points

### Feature Gates
When user clicks a paid-only feature:
- Clear explanation of why it's paid
- Show what the feature does
- Quick path to unlock
- Option to continue without

### Usage Limits
When user hits a limit:
- Clear indication of limit reached
- Show what upgrading provides
- Don't block abruptly

### Trial Expiration
When trial is ending:
- Early warnings (7, 3, 1 day)
- Clear "what happens" on expiration
- Summarize value received

### Time-Based Prompts
After X days of free use:
- Gentle upgrade reminder
- Highlight unused paid features
- Easy to dismiss

## Paywall Screen Components

1. **Headline** - Focus on what they get: "Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]"

2. **Value Demonstration** - Preview, before/after, "With Pro you could..."

3. **Feature Comparison** - Highlight key differences, current plan marked

4. **Pricing** - Clear, simple, annual vs. monthly options

5. **Social Proof** - Customer quotes, "X teams use this"

6. **CTA** - Specific and value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"

7. **Escape Hatch** - Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"

2. What triggers upgrade prompts today?

4. What's your "aha moment" for users?
5. What pricing model? (per seat, usage, flat)
6. Mobile app, web app, or both?

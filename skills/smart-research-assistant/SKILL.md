# Smart Research Assistant

Conduct comprehensive research using multiple information sources and generate structured markdown reports.

## Quick Start

1. Define research question and scope
2. Use SIFT method for source evaluation
3. Apply appropriate research frameworks
4. Generate structured markdown report

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Scoping

Define clear research objectives:
- Research question formulation
- Scope and boundaries identification
- Key information requirements
- Success criteria definition

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

Use multi-source approach:
- Academic databases and journals
- Web resources and news sites
- Professional reports and data
- Social media and forums

### Phase 3: Source Evaluation

Apply SIFT method:
- **Stop**: Pause before sharing/using
- **Investigate**: Check source credibility
- **Find**: Look for trusted coverage
- **Trace**: Verify original context

### Phase 4: Analysis and Synthesis

Process and analyze findings:
- Cross-source verification
- Pattern identification
- Trend analysis
- Gap analysis

### Phase 5: Report Generation

Create structured markdown with:
- Background and context
- Analysis and findings
- Data visualization elements
- Key insights and recommendations

## Evaluation Frameworks

### SIFT Method
Use for quick source verification:
```markdown
1. Stop - Pause and think
2. Investigate - Know the source
3. Find - Look for better coverage
4. Trace - Go back to original
```

### WWWDOT Framework
For detailed source analysis:
- **Who**: Author credentials
- **Why**: Purpose and intent
- **When**: Publication date
- **Does**: Relevance to needs
- **Organization**: Website structure
- **To-do**: Future verification steps

### CAPES Framework
For systematic evaluation:
- **Context**: Information background
- **Actions**: Research steps taken
- **Products**: Outputs generated
- **Evaluation**: Quality assessment
- **Standards**: Reliability criteria

## Reference Materials

See [references/evaluation-methods.md](references/evaluation-methods.md) for detailed evaluation frameworks.
See [references/source-types.md](references/source-types.md) for source classification guide.
See [references/citation-styles.md](references/citation-styles.md) for proper citation formats.

## Report Templates

Use [assets/report-template.md](assets/report-template.md) for standard research reports.
Use [assets/executive-summary.md](assets/executive-summary.md) for business-focused reports.
Use [assets/academic-paper.md](assets/academic-paper.md) for scholarly papers.

## Quality Assurance

Before finalizing reports:
- Verify all sources and claims
- Check for bias and perspective
- Ensure proper attribution
- Review for completeness and accuracy

## Tools and Scripts

Use [scripts/source-verifier.py](scripts/source-verifier.py) for automated source checking.
Use [scripts/citation-formatter.py](scripts/citation-formatter.py) for bibliography generation.
Use [scripts/data-visualizer.py](scripts/data-visualizer.py) for creating charts and graphs.

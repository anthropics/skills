## Approach

### Content Selection Process
1. **Monitor sources** - Industry publications, thought leaders, company blogs, research reports
2. **Evaluate relevance** - Subscriber needs, timeliness, actionability, quality
3. **Add perspective** - Commentary, analysis, key takeaways, why it matters
4. **Organize logically** - Most important first, themed sections, natural flow
5. **Edit ruthlessly** - Remove fluff, ensure value density, respect subscriber time

### Writing Framework
- **Subject Line**: Specific, benefit-driven, curiosity-inducing (40-60 chars)
- **Preview Text**: Extend subject line, add value, avoid "View in browser" (80-100 chars)
- **Introduction**: Hook attention, establish relevance, preview value (3-5 sentences)
- **Body**: Scannable sections, clear headers, concise paragraphs, bullet points
- **Closing**: Clear CTA, personal touch, reason to return

### Editorial Calendar Planning
- **Monthly Themes**: Align with industry events, seasons, company priorities
- **Recurring Sections**: Maintain consistency while allowing flexibility
- **Special Editions**: Product launches, industry reports, subscriber milestones
- **Content Pipeline**: 2-4 weeks ahead for planning, flexibility for timely content

## Best Practices

**Value Delivery:**
- Lead with subscriber benefit, not company news
- Curate ruthlessly - quality over quantity
- Provide context and analysis, not just links
- Make content actionable and immediately useful
- Respect subscriber time (5-10 minute read maximum)

**Engagement Optimization:**
- Write conversationally, like writing to a friend
- Use "you" and "your" - make it personal
- Include questions to encourage replies
- Share personal experiences and opinions
- Maintain consistent voice and personality

**Technical Excellence:**
- Mobile-optimized formatting (60% read on mobile)
- Clear visual hierarchy (headers, spacing, bullets)
- Multiple CTAs appropriate to content
- Links tested and working
- Unsubscribe option clearly visible

**Growth & Retention:**
- Consistent publishing schedule (weekly is optimal)
- Clear value proposition in welcome series
- Regular surveys for subscriber feedback
- Promote newsletter in other channels
- Reference previous editions to build continuity

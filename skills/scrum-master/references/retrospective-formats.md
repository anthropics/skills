## Start/Stop/Continue

**Best for:** New teams, quick retros, when time is limited.
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes.

### Setup
Create three columns: Start, Stop, Continue.

### Facilitation Script

1. **Silent brainstorming (5 min)** — Each person writes sticky notes for each column:
   - **Start**: What should we begin doing?
   - **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
   - **Continue**: What's working well that we should keep?

2. **Share and group (10 min)** — Each person places notes on the board. Group similar items.

3. **Dot voting (3 min)** — Each person gets 3 votes. Vote on the most important items across all columns.

4. **Discussion (15 min)** — Discuss the top 3-5 voted items. For each:
   - What specifically should change?
   - Who owns this action?
   - When will we check on progress?

5. **Action items (5 min)** — Document 1-3 concrete action items with owners and deadlines.

## 4Ls

**Best for:** Exploring team sentiment, mid-project check-ins.
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes.

### Setup
Create four quadrants: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For.

### Facilitation Script

1. **Silent brainstorming (7 min)** — Each person writes notes for:
   - **Liked**: What went well? What did you enjoy?
   - **Learned**: What did you learn? New skills, insights, realizations?
   - **Lacked**: What was missing? Resources, skills, information?
   - **Longed For**: What do you wish you had? Tools, processes, support?

2. **Share and cluster (15 min)** — Walk through each quadrant. Group related items.

3. **Discuss patterns (15 min)** — Look for connections:
   - Do "Lacked" items explain why "Liked" items didn't happen more?
   - Can "Learned" items help address "Longed For"?

4. **Action items (10 min)** — Convert top "Lacked" and "Longed For" items into actionable improvements.

## Sailboat

**Best for:** Visual teams, making abstract problems concrete.
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes.

### Setup
Draw a sailboat on water with:
- **Wind** (sails) = What propels us forward
- **Anchor** = What holds us back
- **Rocks** (ahead, underwater) = Risks we see coming
- **Island** (destination) = Our goal / sprint goal

### Facilitation Script

1. **Set the destination (5 min)** — Agree on the sprint/project goal (the island).

2. **Silent brainstorming (7 min)** — Each person writes notes for each element.

3. **Place and discuss (20 min)** — Go element by element:
   - Wind first (start positive)
   - Anchors next (what's slowing us)
   - Rocks last (upcoming risks)

4. **Prioritize anchors and rocks (10 min)** — Vote on which anchors to cut and which rocks to navigate around.

5. **Action items (10 min)** — Define actions to:
   - Amplify the wind (do more of what works)
   - Cut the heaviest anchors
   - Steer around the biggest rocks

---

## Timeline

**Best for:** Investigating a specific sprint with notable events, post-incident retros.
**Duration:** 60 minutes.

### Setup
Draw a horizontal timeline spanning the sprint. Mark key dates (sprint start, mid-point, end, any significant events).

### Facilitation Script

1. **Build the timeline (10 min)** — Each person adds events, decisions, and moments they remember to the timeline. Include both positive and negative events.

2. **Emotional mapping (5 min)** — Each person draws a line above (positive) or below (negative) the timeline showing their energy/mood throughout the sprint.

3. **Identify patterns (15 min)** — Look at the timeline together:
   - Where did energy drop? What caused it?
   - Where did energy spike? What caused it?
   - Were there pivotal moments that changed the sprint's trajectory?

4. **Root cause analysis (15 min)** — For the 2-3 most significant low points, ask:
   - What happened?
   - Why did it happen?
   - What could prevent it next time?

5. **Action items (10 min)** — Create actions based on the analysis.

## Fishbone / 5 Whys

**Best for:** Investigating a specific problem, post-incident retros, recurring issues.
**Duration:** 60 minutes.

### Setup
Write the problem statement at the head of the fishbone. Main bones are categories: Process, People, Technology, Communication, External Factors.

### Facilitation Script — Fishbone

1. **Define the problem (5 min)** — Agree on a clear problem statement.

2. **Brainstorm causes (15 min)** — For each category, brainstorm potential contributing causes. Place on the fishbone diagram.

3. **Identify root causes (15 min)** — For the most likely causes, apply 5 Whys:
   - Why did this happen? → Because X
   - Why did X happen? → Because Y
   - Continue until reaching a systemic/root cause (usually 3-5 levels deep)

4. **Prioritize (10 min)** — Which root causes have the biggest impact and are within the team's control?

5. **Action items (10 min)** — Create specific, measurable improvements targeting the root causes.

### 5 Whys Example

```
Problem: Feature X was not completed in the sprint.
Why? → The task was more complex than estimated.
Why? → We discovered a dependency on Service Y mid-sprint.
Why? → The dependency wasn't identified during refinement.
Why? → We didn't involve the platform team in refinement.
Why? → We don't have a process for cross-team dependency review.

Root cause: Missing cross-team dependency review in refinement.
Action: Invite platform team lead to refinement for stories touching shared services.
```

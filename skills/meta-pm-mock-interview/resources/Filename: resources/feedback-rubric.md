# Feedback Rubric — Meta PM Mock Interview

Use this rubric to evaluate candidates at the end of each mock session.

---

## Scoring Scale

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Exceptional — hire signal, would stand out at Meta |
| B+ | Strong — clear pass with minor polish needed |
| B | Solid — passes but needs improvement in 1–2 areas |
| C | Below bar — significant gaps, needs more prep |

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Structure
- Did the candidate follow the framework? (PS: 5 steps, AT: 5 steps)
- Were transitions between sections clearly signaled (waypointing)?
- Did they state a game plan upfront and check in with the interviewer?

### 2. User Empathy
- Was the chosen persona specific and vivid?
- Were pain points grounded in real user experience, not abstract?
- Did the candidate demonstrate genuine understanding of user needs?

### 3. Strategic Thinking
- Did choices connect to business outcomes?
- Was prioritization explicitly justified (not just asserted)?
- Did the candidate show awareness of Meta's ecosystem and competitive context?

### 4. Metrics Quality (AT focus)
- Was the NSM defensible and well-justified vs. alternatives?
- Were guardrail metrics meaningful and non-obvious?
- Did goal-setting include a justified number, not just a direction?

### 5. Communication Speed
- Did the candidate communicate at a clear, confident pace?
- Did they avoid over-explaining or under-explaining?
- Did they use crisp language, or were there long rambling sections?

### 6. Outcome Focus
- Did the candidate stay in problem space before jumping to solutions?
- Were solutions tied back to the specific problem and user identified?
- Did the recommendation feel earned, not predetermined?

## Benchmark Examples

### Strong segmentation (B+/A):
"I want to focus on solo entrepreneurs who sell handmade goods and currently rely on Instagram DMs to close sales — they're high-frequency Marketplace users but have zero post-sale workflow support."

### Weak segmentation (B/C):
"I'll focus on small business owners who want to grow their business."

### Strong NSM justification (B+/A):
"I'd use 'listings closed per seller per week' because it reflects value delivered to both sides of the marketplace — sellers get revenue, buyers get goods — and it can grow indefinitely as we add more sellers. I'd pair it with 'time-to-first-response' as a guardrail to ensure we're not gaming closings with low-quality matches."

### Weak NSM (B/C):
"I'd track number of listings posted per day, since more listings means a healthier marketplace."

GitHub Copilot for Flutter has evolved from simple autocompletion to a deep "agentic" workflow that understands project-wide architecture. To maximize its utility in the Flutter project, you should focus on these specialized "skills" and configurations.

Skill Specification and Configurations:
1. Configure Provider-Specific "Rules"
Create a .github/copilot-instructions.md file to force Copilot into a "Provider-first" mindset. This prevents the AI from mixing styles. 
    - Key Instruction: "Always use ChangeNotifier with ChangeNotifierProvider for state management".
Architectural Guardrail: "Prefer using context.read<T>() for actions (callbacks) and context.watch<T>() or Consumer<T> for UI updates".
    - Avoid Ephemeral State: Explicitly tell Copilot: "Do not use Providers for ephemeral state like TextEditingController or simple animations; use StatefulWidget for these". 

2. High-Velocity Scaffolding Prompts
Use these targeted prompts in the Copilot Chat (@workspace) to generate boilerplate instantly: 
    - For Models: "Create a UserProvider class extending ChangeNotifier with a private _user object, a getter, and a updateProfile method that calls notifyListeners()".
    - For Multi-Provider Setup: "Generate a MultiProvider wrapper for main.dart including UserProvider, SettingsProvider, and CartProvider".
    - For Selective Rebuilds: "Convert this widget to use Selector instead of Consumer to only rebuild when the isLoggedIn property of AuthProvider changes". 

3. "Agentic" Refactoring with Provider
The Copilot Coding Agent (2025 feature) can handle multi-file state migrations: 
    - Task: "Refactor the current ProfileScreen and its children to pull data from a new ProfileProvider instead of passing parameters through constructors."
    - Optimization: "Analyze my Build methods and suggest where to use context.select to improve performance by reducing unnecessary rebuilds". 

4. Integration with Modern Flutter 2025 Patterns
    - Clean Architecture: Instruct Copilot to place Providers in a presentation/providers/ directory and keep them separate from pure business logic in the domain/ layer.
    - Testing: Prompt: "Generate a widget test for LoginScreen that mocks AuthProvider using the mocktail package".

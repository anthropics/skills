- Replace primary market research
- Guarantee competitive positioning success

## Examples

### Example 1: Sales Tech Battle Card Request
**User:** "Create a battle card for Outreach vs our sales engagement platform"

**Response:** Research Outreach.io positioning, features, pricing → Identify key differentiators → Create battle card with: Overview, Key Features, Pricing, Strengths, Weaknesses, Our Advantages, How to Win, Objection Handling

### Example 2: Market Landscape Analysis
**User:** "Map the competitive landscape for HR tech ATS solutions"

**Response:** Identify top 10 ATS providers → Analyze by company size focus (SMB/Mid-Market/Enterprise) → Map by capabilities (Recruitment Marketing, Collaborative Hiring, Analytics) → Create positioning matrix with strategic recommendations

### Example 3: Win/Loss Analysis
**User:** "We lost a deal to Workday. Help me understand why."

**Response:** Analyze typical Workday advantages (enterprise scale, ERP integration, brand) → Identify decision factors (likely integration requirements, implementation timeline, total cost) → Recommend competitive positioning adjustments → Suggest future deal qualification criteria

## Notes

- This skill focuses on ethical competitive intelligence using publicly available information
- Always verify competitive claims before using in sales materials
- Competitive landscapes evolve rapidly - information should be refreshed quarterly
- Battle cards are most effective when co-created with sales teams based on real objections
- Win/loss analysis requires honest customer feedback to be truly valuable

Use this skill to systematically research competitors, create actionable sales enablement materials, and develop winning competitive positioning strategies.

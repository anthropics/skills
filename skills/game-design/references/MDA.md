# MDA Framework

The MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) framework provides a formal approach to understanding games. Created by Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek.

## The Three Layers

### Mechanics
The rules, components, and systems that make up the game.

**What to define:**
- Player actions (verbs): move, jump, shoot, build, trade
- Game objects: characters, items, terrain, resources
- Rules: what's allowed, what happens when, win/loss conditions
- Numbers: health values, damage, costs, timers

**Designer perspective:** Mechanics are what you directly control. They're the knobs you turn.

### Dynamics
The runtime behavior that emerges when players interact with mechanics.

**What to observe:**
- Strategies players develop
- Patterns of play that emerge
- Social behaviors in multiplayer
- Pacing and rhythm of gameplay
- Risk/reward decisions players face

**Key insight:** Dynamics are emergent—you design mechanics, but dynamics happen. You can't force dynamics, only create conditions for them.

### Aesthetics
The emotional responses evoked in players.

**The 8 Aesthetic Categories:**

| Aesthetic | Description | Example Games |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Sensation** | Game as sense-pleasure | Journey, Flower, rhythm games |
| **Fantasy** | Game as make-believe | RPGs, simulation games |
| **Narrative** | Game as drama | Story-driven games, visual novels |
| **Challenge** | Game as obstacle course | Dark Souls, puzzle games |
| **Fellowship** | Game as social framework | Party games, MMOs, co-op games |
| **Discovery** | Game as uncharted territory | Metroidvanias, open worlds |
| **Expression** | Game as self-discovery | Creative games, character creators |
| **Submission** | Game as pastime | Idle games, relaxation games |

## MDA Causality

```
Designer builds → MECHANICS
Mechanics create → DYNAMICS
Dynamics produce → AESTHETICS ← Player experiences
```

**Critical insight:** Players experience games aesthetics-first. They feel fun (or don't) before they understand why. Designers work mechanics-first—you can only directly manipulate rules.

This means: **Design backward, build forward.**
1. Decide what emotions you want (aesthetics)
2. Imagine what behaviors would create those emotions (dynamics)
3. Design rules that encourage those behaviors (mechanics)

## Common MDA Misalignments

**Mechanic doesn't produce intended dynamic:**
- You added a cooperation mechanic, but players compete anyway
- Fix: examine incentives. What does the mechanic actually reward?

**Dynamic doesn't produce intended aesthetic:**
- Players are strategizing deeply but not having fun
- Fix: the dynamic might be right for Challenge but you wanted Fellowship

**Aesthetic mismatch with audience:**
- Your game delivers Discovery but your players wanted Challenge
- Fix: either change the game or change your target audience

## Using MDA for Analysis

When analyzing a game:

1. **Play first, analyze second** — Experience the aesthetics before dissecting
2. **List all mechanics** — Be exhaustive; small rules matter
3. **Observe dynamics** — What do players actually do? (Watch streams, read forums)
4. **Map to aesthetics** — Which of the 8 categories does this game deliver?
5. **Trace the chain** — Can you explain how each mechanic contributes to the final aesthetic?

## Using MDA for Design

When designing a game:

1. **Pick 1-2 primary aesthetics** — Focus is essential, especially for indie scope
2. **Study games that nail those aesthetics** — What dynamics create them?
3. **Design mechanics that encourage those dynamics** — Work backward
4. **Playtest for aesthetics** — Ask "how did that feel?" not "did you like the rules?"
5. **Iterate at the mechanics level** — To change feelings, change rules

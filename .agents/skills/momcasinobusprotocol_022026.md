# CASINO BUS PROTOCOL
*by COCO*

A reusable skill that generates a complete, date-specific Casino Bus Night breakdown — every time it runs, it's live, current, and accurate.

---

## TRIGGER

User says any of the following:
- "Run the casino protocol"
- "Casino bus for [date]"
- "Generate Mom's schedule"
- "Casino night [date]"

**On trigger:** Immediately ask for the target date if not provided. Then execute the full protocol below without further confirmation.

---

## STEP 0 — DATE SELECTION

Always prompt:
> "What date is the casino bus trip? (MM/DD/YY)"

Accept any date. Default to today if user says "today" or "tonight."

---

## STEP 1 — NUMEROLOGY COMPUTATION

### Date Reduction Formula
Add all digits of the date together, reduce to single digit (except 11, 22, 33).

**Example: 02/19/26**
0+2+1+9+2+6 = 20 → 2+0 = **2 (11/2)**

### Day Archetypes (GG33 System)
| Code | Archetype | Casino Tone |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Leadership / New starts / Bold action | Active — push early |
| 2 / 11 | Duality / Patience / Visionary pulse | Subtle flow — trust intuition |
| 3 | Expression / Creativity / Social | Communicative energy |
| 4 | Structure / Builder / Grinding | Disciplined — no gambling instincts |
| 5 | Change / Risk / Volatility | CAUTION — unpredictable swings |
| 6 | Smooth / Steady / Family | FAVORABLE — lower chaos |
| 7 | Quiet / Stop-start / Reflective | MODERATE — patience required |
| 8 | Money / Power / Authority | HIGHLY FAVORABLE — power window |
| 9 | Closure / Completion / Release | Endings energy — exit discipline critical |
| 11 | Visionary / Heightened intuition | Trust gut — read the room |
| 22 | Master Builder / Rare power | Rare — structured excellence |
| 33 | Master Teacher / Peak frequency | Peak — maximum awareness |

### Universal Year (2026)
2+0+2+6 = 10 → 1+0 = **1 — Leadership / New Era / Self-Initiation**

Apply Year 1 energy as macro backdrop to all timing. Actions taken this year carry "first mover" weight.

---

## STEP 2 — LIVE DATA FETCH

Use **web search** to retrieve current data for the target date. Never use assumed or cached data.

1. **Lunar Phase**
   - Query: `lunar phase [month] [day] [year]`
   - Extract: Phase name, illumination %, Moon sign, void-of-course windows

2. **Astrological Transits**
   - Query: `astrology transits [month] [day] [year] daily`
   - Extract: Key planetary energy, void-of-course Moon windows (avoid these), notable aspects

3. **Chinese Zodiac Year Check (auto-apply through 2026)**
   - 2026 = Year of the Fire Horse
   - Horse vs Monkey = Direct Clash (冲)
   - **FLAG: HIGH RESISTANCE ENVIRONMENT for Monkey energy**
   - Adjust tone: tighten strategy, reduce risk, protect gains aggressively
   - Note: Applies to GJ (Water Monkey). Mom's profile adjusts separately if her sign is known.

## STEP 3 — SCHEDULE GENERATION

### Fixed Bus Timeline (Non-Negotiable)
| Event | Time |
|-------|------|
| Depart Home | 7:00 PM |
| Arrive Casino | ~8:00 PM |
| Leave Casino | 1:45 AM |
| Arrive Home | ~3:00 AM |

### Window Structure
**Generate exactly 6 windows per output. Mark ONE as BEST LUCK WINDOW.**

Shift BEST LUCK WINDOW based on date numerology:
- Day 1, 3, 8 → 9:30–11:00 PM (peak early)
- Day 2, 6, 7 → 10:15–11:30 PM (mid-session)
- Day 4, 5, 9 → 11:00 PM–12:30 AM (late build — exit discipline critical)

### Window Templates

**WINDOW 1 — 8:00–9:00 PM | ARRIVAL / SOFT ENTRY**
- Walk the floor first. Do not sit immediately.
- Small bets only. No pressure.
- Read the room. Let energy settle.
- 1 machine max, minimum denomination.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- Observe which sections are active — high traffic = high energy
- Do not respond to FOMO on early wins you see others hit
- Set your session budget here, mentally or on paper

**WINDOW 2 — 9:00–[X] PM | BUILD MODE**
- 1–2 machines max. No hopping.
- Conservative steady play.
- Stay on a machine for at least 20 min before deciding to move.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- If machine is cold after 20 min, give it one more cycle then move
- Track your credits — know your baseline
- No doubling up to recover early losses

**WINDOW 3 — [X]–[X] PM | ⭐ BEST LUCK WINDOW ⭐**
- Strongest energy alignment of the night.
- Moderate pressure allowed.
- If ahead: LOCK PROFIT immediately. Do not reinvest without a plan.
- If behind: Cap losses here. Do not chase.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- This is the window — be present, not distracted
- Have your win-lock number decided BEFORE this window opens
- If you hit during this window, walk away and reset before continuing

**WINDOW 4 — [BREAK] | INTENTIONAL RESET**
- 15–20 min break. Non-negotiable.
- Walk floor. Drink water. Recalibrate.
- Protection from fatigue and tilt — not downtime. Never skip.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- Step outside or to the food area — full scene change
- This is the break that saves the night, not wastes it
- Reassess your position: up, down, or even — adjust next windows accordingly

**WINDOW 5 — [X]–1:30 AM | TAPER**
- Light play only. No high-volatility machines.
- Protect everything gained. Low denomination, low pressure.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- Penny or nickel denomination only during taper
- If you're up, your only job now is to leave with it
- No new machines. Stay with what you know.

**WINDOW 6 — 1:45 AM | EXIT**
- Get on the bus. No last spins. No "one more."
- Win or lose — the schedule says leave.

**TIPS / KEYS:**
- Cash out 15 min before bus time — avoid lines
- The bus is the hard stop. Honor it.
- Debrief on the ride home — what worked, what didn't

---

## STEP 4 — COSMIC CONTEXT BLOCK

Include at top of every output:

```
🌙 LUNAR: [Phase] in [Sign] — [illumination]% illuminated
🔢 DAY CODE: [reduced number] — [archetype]
🌍 YEAR CODE: 1 — Leadership / New Era
⚡ KEY TRANSIT: [Top 1-2 relevant transits for that date]
🐒 RESISTANCE CHECK: [Horse Year flag or clear — state it plainly]
```

---

## STEP 5 — HARD RULES FOOTER

Always append. Never omit.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  HARD RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☐  Set loss limit BEFORE arriving
☐  Win-lock rule: lock a % when ahead
☐  No emotional chasing
☐  No "one last try"
☐  Leave on the bus at 1:45 AM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This is timing + probability. Not a guarantee.
```

---

## STEP 6 — EXPORT + DEPLOY

After generating the full schedule, ask:

> "How do you want to export this?
> **A)** HTML card
> **B)** PNG poster
> **C)** Both"

---

### If A or C — HTML Card

Generate artifact as: `CasinoBusProtocol-Card_022026.html`

**Design System: LVxART**
- Background: vibrant watercolor gradient (hot pink → purple → cyan)
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headers) + DM Sans (body) via Google Fonts
- Color: Full rainbow multicolor palette — hot pink `#EC4899`, electric purple `#A855F7`, cyan `#3B82F6`, amber `#F59E0B`, green `#10B981`, red `#EF4444`
- Animated shimmer rainbow bars top and bottom (CSS keyframe animation)
- Frosted glass cards with backdrop-filter blur
- All 6 windows **collapsible** — tap header to expand/collapse
- All windows **collapsed by default** on load
- Gradient rainbow border on BEST LUCK WINDOW card
- PEAK badge on best window
- Mobile-proportioned: max-width 430px

**Then deploy to CF Worker:**

**A) POST to CF Worker:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ai.xxey.es/casino \
  -H "Content-Type: text/html" \
  --data-binary @CasinoBusProtocol-Card_022026.html
```

**B) Confirm 201 response + KV write success**

**C) Share live URL with recipient:**
```
https://ai.xxey.es/casino
(date-versioned: https://ai.xxey.es/casino?date=YYYY-MM-DD)
```

**D) Fallback:** AirDrop / iMessage the `.html` file directly if CF Worker is unreachable

---

### If B or C — PNG Poster

Generate artifact as: `CasinoBusProtocol-Poster_022026.png`

**Design System: LVxART**
- Canvas: 900×1800px
- Background: White `#FEFCF8` + watercolor radial blob washes (hot pink, purple, cyan, amber, green)
- Rainbow gradient bar: top 30px and bottom 30px
- All 6 windows fully visible — no collapsing in poster format
- BEST LUCK window gets rainbow glow border treatment
- Title: "CASINO BUS PROTOCOL" / Credits: "by COCO"
- Include tips/keys for each timeframe window

**Font sizes (minimum — never go smaller):**
| Element | Size | Weight |
|---------|------|--------|
| Header title | 36px | Bold |
| Date / eyebrow | 16–18px | Regular / Bold |
| Section labels | 13px | Bold |
| Window time labels | 13px | Bold |
| Window titles | 20px | Bold |
| Tip bullet text | 14px | Regular |
| Hard rules text | 14px | Regular |
| Footer | 13px | Bold |

---

## SYSTEM RULES

- Primary data: Live web search per date. Never use cached or assumed data.
- Never guarantee outcomes. Frame everything as timing + probability.
- Tone: Calm. Disciplined. Kuya energy for creative moments, zero-emotion on strategy.
- Screenshot-friendly formatting always.
- One BEST LUCK WINDOW per output. Never two.
- Break windows = protection. Never frame as optional.
- Loss and win discipline are non-negotiable inclusions.
- File naming: `CasinoBusProtocol_MMDDYY`

---

## LIMITATIONS

- Lunar engine: web search dependent — accuracy tied to source
- Mom's personal numerology profile not yet in system (add when available)
- No real-time transit API — uses search-based astrology data
- Bus schedule fixed unless user updates it
- HTML sharing = local file + CF Worker deployment (see Step 6)

---

## UPGRADE ROADMAP

| Priority | Feature | Method |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Done | Host as live URL | Cloudflare Workers + KV at ai.xxey.es/casino |
| Next | Mom's personal numerology profile | Add DOB to master dataset |
| Future | Real-time transit API | Astro-seek or similar |
| Future | Auto-generate on schedule | Cron trigger via Workers |

---

## EVALS (TEST DATES)

| # | Date | Day # | Notes |

| 0 | 02/19/26 | 2 (11/2) | Thursday baseline — live test ✓ |
| 1 | 03/07/26 | 9 | Completion day — closure energy |
| 2 | 08/08/26 | 8 | Power day — 888 matrix |

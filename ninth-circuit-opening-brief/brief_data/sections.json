THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY REMAINS LIVE AND WITHIN THE COURT'S ARTICLE III JURISDICTION 7\nISSUE(S) PRESENTED 9\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE 10\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 55\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW 56\nARGUMENT 57\n1) Factor One: Control of Property. 59\na) Neither court exercised jurisdiction over any res. 59\n2) Factor Two: Inconvenience of Forum. 60\na) The federal courthouse in Portland sits fifteen miles from the Clackamas County Courthouse. 60\n3) Factor Three: Avoidance of Piecemeal Litigation. 60\na) Only the federal action unites all defendants—West Linn, Officers Blyth, and Gunnarson would have gone to trial with a ghost to blame things on, 60\nb) Clackamas County evaded 13 services, this would have rewarded them for intentional evasion and lack of accountability… something history shows as routine in Clackamas, 60\nc) DDA Portlock Also would have been seperated because Plaintiff didn't have the fraud evidence at the time, and who knew evidence would still be blocked through DDA. 60\nd) The state court had already fragmented the litigation by dismissing the County defendants on April 11, 2023, and May 11, 2022 while allowing the West Linn defendants to remain. ECF 35-2, 35-3. 60\ne) Federal abstention would not avoid piecemeal litigation; it would guarantee it. This factor favors federal retention. 60\n4) Factor Four: Order in Which Jurisdiction Was Obtained and Progress of Litigation. 61\na) Due to the defendants own actions, in avoiding the service and hiding behind UTCR 7.020, giving notice that should be voided, and Plaintiffs Pro se status he wasn't aware of the the path to Default judgment. Additionally the notice given gave no name or statute (it gave UTCR 7 as apposed to UTCR 7.020) with two John Does, His AOB case just entering the Oregon Court of Appeals and they lost his Appeal, meanwhile litigating, and living out of state caused the County to escape state without ever appearing. By Oregon law, County could no show, in hopes that Plaintiff doesn't file the proper Default Application, they can send notice on a link via bulk email, and if Plaintiff does catch it, they can then show up with no penalty, however if they do not they get to call repetitive Prejudice against a Plaintiff who now has to start over to and serve you for another dozen times? for their intentional obstruction? Does this even need to be argued? (The state court register shows that Clackamas County was served approximately fifteen times but never answered, never moved, and never appeared. ECF 35-4. On April 4, 2023, Appellant filed a Motion to Compel Appearance. Seven days later, on April 11, 2023, the court dismissed the County defendants \"for want of prosecution\"—not for the County's failure to appear, but for Appellant's supposed failure to prosecute. ECF 35-2, 35-3. Meanwhile, the federal case reached responsive pleadings from every defendant. ECF 34, 36, 37. This factor strongly favors federal retention. 61\n5) 5. Factor Five: Adequacy of State Forum. 61\n6) 6. Factor Six: Forum Shopping. 62\n7) C. AIU's \"Compelling Reason\" Exception Applies. 63\n8) D.

[Insert appropriate heading for the argument on issue #2] 90\nCONCLUSION 91\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAppellees move to dismiss this appeal on a single, factually incorrect premise: that Appellant's Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment (Rule 59(e)) was untimely, and therefore failed to toll the deadline to file a Notice of Appeal.\nThis argument is foreclosed by the District Court's own finding. In its October 8, 2025 Order (ECF No. 65), the District Court explicitly acknowledged that Appellant \"timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.\"\nBecause the tolling motion was timely filed on October 1, 2025, the deadline to appeal did not begin to run until the District Court disposed of that motion on October 3, 2025. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025—well within the 30-day window. Accordingly, jurisdiction is proper, and the Motion to Dismiss must be denied.\n\nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTIONAL FACTS\n1. September 3, 2025: The District Court entered Judgment dismissing the case (ECF No. 60).\n2. October 1, 2025 (The Deadline): Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), the deadline to file a motion to alter or amend was 28 days later: October 1, 2025.\n3. October 1, 2025 at 11:57 PM: Appellant submitted his Rule 59(e) motion via the CM/ECF system. The system generated a receipt confirming the document was received on this date. See Exhibit A (CM/ECF Receipt timestamped 11:57 PM). Due to a clerical error during the electronic submission process, the document was routed to the related, remanded case number (3:24-cv-00838-SB) rather than the active case number (3:24-cv-00839-SB).\n4. October 2, 2025 at 1:06 AM: Just 66 minutes past the midnight deadline, Appellant realized the routing error and emailed all defense counsel the full motion and 29 exhibits, providing actual notice. See Exhibit B (Email to Counsel dated Oct 2, 2025, 1:06 AM).\n5. October 3, 2025: The District Court entered an order denying the Rule 59(e) motion on its merits (ECF No. 63).\n6. October 8, 2025: In a subsequent order (ECF No. 65), Magistrate Judge Beckerman made a specific factual finding regarding the October 1 submission: \"...he timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.\"\n7. October 13, 2025: Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 66/67).\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE DISTRICT COURT'S FINDING THAT THE MOTION WAS \"TIMELY FILED\" IS DISPOSITIVE.\nAppellees ask this Court to ignore the District Court's own assessment of the record. In ECF No. 65, the District Court denied nunc pro tunc relief on procedural grounds but expressly validated the timeliness of the physical act of filing: \"...because he timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.\"\nA filing is deemed \"filed\" when it is placed in the possession of the clerk. See United States v. Dae Rim Fishery Co., 794 F.2d 1392, 1395 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that a complaint is filed when it is placed in the actual or constructive custody of the clerk, regardless of subsequent clerical errors). Appellant placed the motion in the custody of the CM/ECF system on October 1, 2025. The District Court acknowledged this fact. Therefore, the motion was timely.\n\nII. A TIMELY RULE 59(e) MOTION TOLLS THE APPEAL DEADLINE REGARDLESS OF DOCKETING ERRORS.\nUnder Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of a timely Rule 59 motion.\n• Step 1: The Rule 59 motion was timely filed on October 1, 2025 (per ECF 65 and Dae Rim Fishery).\n• Step 2: The appeal deadline was tolled until the Court disposed of that motion.\n• Step 3: The Court disposed of the motion on October 3, 2025 (ECF No. 63).\n• Step 4: The new 30-day deadline to appeal began on October 3, 2025, expiring on November 2, 2025.\n• Step 5: Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025.\nThe Notice of Appeal was filed 10 days after the tolling period ended. It is timely.\n\nIII. A WRONG CASE NUMBER IS A CURABLE TECHNICAL DEFECT.\nThe Supreme Court and this Circuit have long held that form should not triumph over substance, particularly for pro se litigants. A clerical error in a case number does not negate the legal effect of a timely submission. See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757 (2001) (imperfections in filing should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about the party's intent).\nFurthermore, Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(4) states: \"The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.\" Rejecting the tolling effect of a motion solely because it was routed to a sister docket number violates the spirit of Rule 5(d)(4).\n\nIV. APPELLEES SUFFERED NO PREJUDICE.\nAppellees received electronic notification of the filing on October 1, 2025 (via the related case docket) and actual service via email at 1:06 AM on October 2, 2025 (See Exhibit B). They were fully aware of the motion and its contents immediately. Their Motion to Dismiss is an attempt to exploit a clerical error to avoid appellate review of the merits.\n\nThe District Court found that Appellant \"timely filed\" his Rule 59(e) motion. That finding triggers the tolling provision of FRAP 4(a)(4). Consequently, the Notice of Appeal filed on October 13, 2025, was timely.\nAppellant respectfully requests that this Court DENY Appellees' Motion to Dismiss and allow this appeal to proceed on the merits.\nDATED: November 27, 2025\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Tyler Allen Lofall\nTyler Allen Lofall, Pro Se\n6880 N.W. 271st Ave\nHillsboro, OR 97124\ntyleralofall@gmail.com\n(386) 262-3322\n________________________________________\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI hereby certify that I electronically filed the foregoing with the Clerk of the Court for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by using the appellate CM/ECF system on November 27, 2025.\n/s/ Tyler Allen Lofall\nTyler Allen Lofall\n________________________________________\nEXHIBIT INDEX\nExhibit A: CM/ECF Receipt showing filing entered 10/1/2025 at 11:57 PM.\nExhibit B: Email to Defense Counsel dated 10/2/2025 at 1:06 AM attaching the motion and exhibits.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff–Appellant Tyler Allen Lofall is a legally blind, pro se litigant who comes to this Court asking for one thing: accountability. Over the last five years, four interlocking proceedings—one civil Assignment of Benefits dispute, one criminal prosecution, and two civil rights actions—have exposed a pattern in which government actors and courts used procedure itself to erase his substantive rights. An irrevocable Assignment of Benefits for $111,943.56 in work fully performed was intercepted and forced into litigation; that litigation was then derailed by a warrantless arrest built on fabricated narratives, followed by a prosecution that became easier to pursue than to correct.\nOnce in custody, Appellant was deliberately exposed to COVID 19, denied basic accommodations for his legal blindness, and had sixty two pro se legal files deleted from the jail law library system. Exculpatory evidence—including body camera footage showing that Macy, not Appellant, wielded the hammer and initiated the destruction—was buried behind DHS seals and discovery games.\nHis AOB civil trial was conducted in absence while he was unlawfully detained. In five years, the only \"trial\" he has effectively seen was a one sided proceeding in which the heirs obtained a counter judgment against him while his claims were dismissed.\nAt the same time, Clackamas County evaded service in state court despite repeated attempts; the state court dismissed those defendants \"for want of prosecution\" while motions to compel their appearance were pending. West Linn defendants obtained repeated set overs timed around parental leave and other conflicts, pushing hearings and trial dates to the edge of statutes of limitation. After Appellant gave more than a year's notice that he would pursue claims against Clackamas County before the limitations period expired, his federal case was dismissed one day after Oregon's 180 day refiling window under ORS 12.220 closed—leaving him with no forum at all. The District Court then labeled this action a \"repetitive lawsuit,\" accepted Appellees' narratives at face value, and ignored submissions documenting fabricated reports, defective notices, and estoppel triggering \"consent then flip\" tactics.\nThose gaps in the record are not a reason to dismiss; they are part of the harm. Appellant lost his property through the spoiled AOB, his liberty through an arrest and detention procured by fabrication, and his ability to obtain counsel or preserve evidence through state created obstacles: evasion of service, suppression of recordings, deletion of files, and carefully timed dismissals. To treat this as an even playing field, or to suggest that Appellant simply \"walked away\" on the eve of a first trial, is to confuse self defense with attempted murder—to equate a homeowner tackling an intruder in his yard with the intruder's crime. When a person is jailed through no fault of his own, loses his case while he is held, and then is told that the resulting procedural tangle is his responsibility, the system is no longer merely mistaken; it is engaging in organized extortion under color of law.\nAppellees now contend they should face no accountability because Appellant is not a lawyer, and because doctrines like abstention and immunity can be stretched to cover lies, missing records, and coordinated obstruction. They are mistaken. The law is clear that courts may not reward fraud upon the court, deliberate evidence destruction, or state created procedural traps. This appeal presents compelling reasons for the Ninth Circuit to intervene: when arresting an innocent person on fabricated reports, issuing defective notices to allow one side to escape liability, concealing evidence across multiple cases, and timing dismissals to guarantee a statute of limitations \"kill shot\" are all treated as ordinary \"case management,\" the problem is no longer just error—it is constitutional violation. This is the last crossroads: either these actors are finally held to account, or the message to every county and city is that they may lie, obstruct, and manipulate the forum against those who cannot afford counsel and expect the courts to look away."

            "text": "1) I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\nThe district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over this civil rights action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3)–(4) because Appellant Tyler Allen Lofall brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. On Sept 3, 2025, Judgement was made in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Portland Division, entered a final judgment in Case No. 3:24-cv-00839-SB that disposed of all claims and all parties. Appellant notified the parties the morning of October first, then filed a timely Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment in the district court. In ECF No. 60, the court expressly found that Appellant \"timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.\" However, corrected it in 66 minutes in addition to the prior notice. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), that timely Rule 59(e) motion tolled the time to appeal. Appellant then filed a notice of appeal on October 14, 2025, within the time allowed by Rule 4(a) as tolled. See Fed. R. App. P. 3, 4(a)(1)(A), 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n2) II. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nFirst Amendment violated: Removed from courtroom, pro se trials, ex parte communications, regarding my personal matters, filing barriers for blind litigant and due to the malicious prosecution and unlawful arrest Appellant has been deprived every having his day in court.\nFourth Amendment violated: False arrest based on fabricated probable cause (March 6, 2022).\nSixth Amendment violated: Court-appointed advisor coordinated with DDA to give false COVID information, canceling trial (June 10, 2022). Legal files deleted, law library denied, corrective lenses withheld, undermined by his advisor, and had his own court appointed attorney withhold evidence, and make decisions on Appellant's behalf with explicit contradictory instructions.\nSeventh Amendment violated: AOB civil trial proceeded without Plaintiff, while unlawfully detained (June 8, 2022). State civil rights case never reached trial—County never appeared. Federal case dismissed without trial.\nFourteenth Amendment violated: Held seven days past release order. Defective notices with blank fields. Federal dismissal timed to Day 181—closing both forums simultaneously, judged without proper review on a non-jurisdictional argument for lack of jurisdiction.\nNinth Amendment violated: Every procedural doctrine—immunity, abstention, time-bar, forum shopping—has been weaponized to crush Plaintiff's substantive rights. \"The 'enumeration' of certain /[guaranteed] rights has been construed to deny [AND] disparaged\" other rights retained by the people.\nIII. THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY REMAINS LIVE AND WITHIN THE COURT'S ARTICLE III JURISDICTION.\nThis appeal arises from a § 1983 action alleging violations of multiple constitutional rights whose combined deprivation caused extreme hardship and left Appellant with no meaningful avenue for relief in the district court:\nUnder United States v. Dae Rim Fishery Co., 794 F.2d 1392, 1395 (9th Cir. 1986), a document is deemed filed when it is placed in the actual or constructive custody of the clerk, regardless of subsequent clerical errors.\nThe District Court explicitly found in its order dated October 8, 2025 (ECF 65) that Appellant \"timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.\" This factual finding is dispositive. Because the motion was \"timely filed\" on October 1, 2025, it triggered the tolling provisions of Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).\nThe time to file the Notice of Appeal did not begin to run until the District Court entered the order disposing of the Rule 59(e) motion on October 3, 2025 (ECF 63). The new 30-day deadline expired on November 2, 2025. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025, well within the timely period"

            "text": "I. THE ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS AND THE THEFT THAT STARTED EVERYTHING\n1. In mid-2020, homeowner Joanna Lee Bozian executed an irrevocable Assignment of Benefits in favor of Plaintiff Tyler Lofall for insurance proceeds arising from fire damage to her residence in Damascus, Oregon. The AOB stated in relevant part: \"For good and valuable consideration received, I, Joanna Lee Bozian irrevocably transfer and assign to Tyler Lofall . . . all cash values, proceeds and benefits arising thereunder.\" (ECF 8, Ex. D at 11–12.) The assignment further acknowledged that \"an estimated 90% of the fire claim stated above has been completed and all work completed at the property has been completed by Tyler Lofall.\" Id. By October 2020, Plaintiff had completed all contracted repair work. The claim was submitted, approved by Assurant Insurance Company, and paid in the amount of $111,943.56. (ECF 8, Ex. D at 52.)\n2. The homeowner died. Her daughter and son-in-law—the \"heirs\"—had not visited the property in twenty years. They contacted the mortgage company and fraudulently convinced JP Morgan that Plaintiff had created the AOB through fraud. They removed Plaintiff's deposit information and inserted their own. (ECF 8, Ex. D at 208.) On November 24, 2020, heir Zac Bond emailed Plaintiff: \"Get out of the house, and we will get you money immediately.\" (ECF 8, Ex. 6.) This was a ruse. After the mortgage inspection passed and funds were cleared for release on November 30, 2020, the very next day—December 1, 2020—the heirs reversed course entirely: \"If you want money from the insurance claim, you will need to file a claim against Jolie's estate like any other creditor.\" (ECF 8, Ex. D at132, lines 611–12.)\nPlaintiff reported this theft to the Clackamas County District Attorney and Sheriff. Both declined to investigate. The DA's office pointed to the Sheriff's Office; the Sheriff's Office told Plaintiff it was \"a civil matter.\" (ECF 8 ¶¶ 8–9.) This official abandonment forced Plaintiff into civil litigation to recover funds he had already earned. He filed Case No. 21CV02575 in Clackamas County Circuit Court in January 2021, proceeding pro se because the heirs' theft had left him indigent. Trial was eventually set for June 8, 2022. Plaintiff would never see that trial. The heirs' theft had set off a chain of events that would cost Plaintiff not only the $111,943.56, but his freedom, his property, his home, and five years of his life.\nII. THE WLPD-COACHED ATTACK: MARCH 4–6, 2022\n3. Plaintiff was staying with a West Linn friend, \"Macy\" Galla, who insisted on him staying there until he finished with his civil claim, since he had already moved his belongings back to Washington and was constantly being called back to court for the AOB case. Due to a combination of Covid, not being paid, his property being spread out from new indigency and the rough departure from Damascus, Plaintiff's current setup in Washougal had no internet and was really just a place to leave things and \"sort of\" have an eye on them that was closer (three hours closer than Lofall, Washington, where he is from). Because he was from out of state, he needed access to internet (not available in Washougal), and Covid-mandated demands and gaps in hearings made it so Plaintiff had large compilations that his basic laptop was not handling with Adobe.\n4. In early March, Macy—annoyed that Plaintiff was spending all his time on his claim and not paying attention to her—snapped when, on the day Plaintiff finished all seven motions he needed before trial, they were returned because his Master Exhibit List did not link directly to the motions. A simple citation was not good enough, nor was the table of contents linked to positions in the master list, which was done. Macy lost it, allegedly stemming from jealousy and substance abuse (backed later by March 7th events). She then took, or had in her possession, Plaintiff's car keys and his AOB work files—contract documents, evidence, and work records critical to his $111,943.56 claim. She irrationally would not return them.\n5. Macy wanted Plaintiff to leave without these things; and as cars do not move without keys, when that did not happen on March 4th, Macy called the West Linn Police Department and asked how to evict him. The answer she received was clear: (a) she could not execute a one-day eviction; and (b) legal process was required.\n6. A. WLPD dispatch logs and Plaintiff's many statements—messages, police reports, and 911 call logs—agree on what followed.\n7. Rather than following lawful eviction procedures, Macy orchestrated a staged arrest with the apparent coaching of law enforcement. (See ECF 8 ¶¶37–44; ECF 15, Ex. 36.)\n8. March 3, 2022. Macy sent Plaintiff a series of text messages while Plaintiff asked for his keys nine times, and Macy made her intentions explicit: \"Come Sunday. Fire it is.\"; \"Burn all your shit too.\" (See ECF 15, Ex. 36 (Pre-Arrest Text Messages).)\n9. March 4, 2022. After learning she could not simply evict Plaintiff and after hanging up on WLPD twice saying she was going to \"burn down the house,\" Macy escalated. (See ECF 8 ¶ 34; ECF 15, Ex. 36.) She went out and purchased five gallons of gasoline. She returned to the property. She took a hammer and dropped a bag at the window over Plaintiff's bed outside, and started with the door, breaking glass: she smashed out seven windows; shattered the door; poured thirty pounds of flour over Plaintiff's bed, tools, clothes, and electronics—the first of three consecutive days of this destruction; cut the power, the heat, and the lights in freezing March temperatures; ran in and tipped the fridge over; and took a garden hose and flooded the inside of the house, spraying the TV, the electronics, the walls—anything she could—and turning everything into a paste. (See ECF 8 ¶¶ 37–44; ECF 15, Ex. 36 (WLPD Incident Report, Mar. 4, 2022).) (10.) Plaintiff called 911. He was the complainant—the victim—reporting criminal conduct. West Linn Police Department officers responded: they observed the broken windows; they documented the gasoline purchase and the arson threats; and they took no action against Macy. She was screaming and carrying five gallons of gasoline, running around the yard when they showed up. Despite her written threats to burn the house down, and despite Plaintiff asking them to take her to the hospital, they did nothing. (See ECF 15, Ex. 36; ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 22–27.)\n10. March 5, 2022 (Morning). Macy continued her rampage. She poured another thirty pounds of flour over Plaintiff's property—sixty pounds total over two days. Officer Goode responded in the morning. He finally confiscated the five gallons of gasoline that his colleagues had left with Macy the day before. He still did not arrest Macy. He left her at the property with Plaintiff's belongings—and the hammer—still inside. (ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 37–44.) (12.) March 5, 2022 (2:24 p.m.). That afternoon, Macy sent Plaintiff a series of text messages that would prove critical to understanding the premeditated nature of what followed: \"Expect to [lose] heat and electricity again\"; \"Windows brake. By themselves. All the time.\"; \"Acetone is a good flame starter\"; \"I have plenty of that\"; \"Cars catch on fire all the time\"; \"If your gone your stuff is safe\"; \"If you think to stay nothing is safe and no one\"; \"I would rather kill you then myself\"; \"I will kill us all first\"; \"I wish you were dead\"; \"Die.\" (Pre-Arrest JSON, Text Message Log (Mar. 5, 2022, 2:24–2:36 p.m.), ECF 15, Ex. 36.)\n11. An hour later, Plaintiff emailed court staff at Clackamas County Circuit Court pleading with them to accept his Master Exhibit List, or for help with it, as he had no way to accomplish this and they now had his only completed copies he immediately had access to. In that email, he wrote: \"I'm at the last crossroad of getting paid and burning the world down . . . I need some answers please because I'm going to end up dead or in prison over this and this is absolutely the judicial system's doing.\" (Pre-Arrest JSON, Correspondence ID 5 (Mar. 5, 2022, 3:35 p.m.).) For fifteen months Plaintiff had asked them for help. The court did not respond. No intervention came. (They offered help on March 7th, but that help was no longer available when Plaintiff was out of jail.)\n12. March 6, 2022: The Staged Arrest. This was the third day. Macy poured another thirty pounds of flour—ninety pounds total over three days—over Plaintiff's property. But this day was different. Macy's daughter's boyfriend, age nineteen, was positioned with a camera. Macy's fourteen-year-old daughter was also present as a witness. This was not a spontaneous domestic dispute. This was orchestrated.\n13. Macy, wearing work gloves and carrying the same hammer she had used to smash the windows, took two garden hoses and began spraying water through the broken windows—directly onto Plaintiff's computers, legal files, television, and bed. Everything Plaintiff owned was being destroyed: his AOB evidence, his legal documents, his tools, his livelihood.\n14. After three days of arson threats, property destruction, and police inaction, Plaintiff did the only thing he could: he grabbed the hose to stop her from destroying his remaining property. Oregon law provides explicit protection for this conduct. ORS 161.229 authorizes the use of physical force to prevent the commission of theft or criminal mischief of property. ORS 161.209 permits physical force in self-defense.\n15. The nineteen-year-old boyfriend took photographs—but the photographs were selective. They captured Plaintiff grabbing the hose. They did not capture the context: the three days of destruction, the arson threats, the gasoline, the hammer in Macy's hand, the ninety pounds of flour, the broken windows, the water being sprayed onto Plaintiff's property. The boyfriend took those photographs directly to the West Linn Police station. He did not wait for officers to arrive at the scene. He delivered the photographs first.\n16. Officers Catlin Blyth and Dana Gunnarson then responded to the residence. They had been privy to the events leading to this event; there were officers in and out of the property every day, stopping by to check on progress. (ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 22–27.) They had already reviewed the photographs at the station. They arrived with pre-formed intent. Within eight minutes—without conducting any investigation, without reviewing dispatch logs showing Plaintiff had been the 911 complainant for three consecutive days, without considering Macy's documented arson threats, without noting the gasoline confiscation the day before—they arrested Plaintiff on a misdemeanor harassment charge, for grabbing a hose from a woman who had spent three days threatening to burn him alive. (ECF 15, Ex.36; ECF 17-1 ¶ 45.)\n17. The officers never personally interviewed Macy at the scene. When Plaintiff argued that it was self-defense, Dana contended he was not allowed self-defense and treated his entire explanation as argumentative. Plaintiff pointed out the broken glass officers stepped on to call him outside while he was salvaging what he could and dragging it outside the reach of Macy's hose. After the arrest, Macy simply went inside and closed the door. The officers' entire basis for probable cause was the photographs delivered to the station by Macy's daughter's boyfriend—photographs that showed Plaintiff's defensive action but obscured Macy's aggression.\n18. Three domestic violence screening surveys were completed at the scene. All three came back negative: \"did not screen in.\" There was no domestic violence. There was no victim. There was only a man defending his property from destruction by a woman who had threatened to kill him. (See ECF 8 ¶ 74; ECF 35-7 at 2.)\n19. On body camera or cruiser cam audio, Officer Blyth would be heard telling Officer Gunnarson they needed to find \"another incident\"—using the exact statutory language of ORS 166.065—and Blyth promising Lofall he could have his body camera footage. They then told Plaintiff they would put his property that was in tubs inside his truck and lock it. They got in the cruiser and looked up the elements of harassment together. He noted \"offensive physical contact\" and \"multiple offenses,\" and Dana marched toward Macy to \"get another incident\" and got the door slammed in her face. This was not investigation. This was fabrication. This is a federal offense.\n20. Plaintiff invoked Oregon's self-defense statutes at the scene—ORS 161.229 (defense of property) and ORS 161.209 (use of physical force). The officers' response: \"That's a trial issue.\"\n21. Self-defense defeats probable cause. If the officers acknowledged that Plaintiff was defending his property from destruction, there was no lawful basis for arrest. By telling him it was a \"trial issue,\" they manufactured an arrest they knew could not survive scrutiny—but that would serve its purpose: removing Plaintiff from the residence, as Macy had wanted when she first called WLPD asking how to evict him.\n22. Plaintiff was booked into Clackamas County Jail. His contact lenses were going to be a problem. His prescription is −11.00/−12.00 diopters, twice the threshold for legal blindness. Without corrective lenses, he cannot see fingers at arm's length. His temporary wear contacts were already beyond date by the time he was jailed; the jail denied his requests for saline solution. The jail denied his requests for medical care for infections. He could not read filings, use the law library, or review discovery. He was rendered unable to participate in his own defense—and in his AOB civil case that was set for trial three months away.\n23. His car keys were never returned. His identification was in tubs by the side of the road and never recovered—a fact that would later prevent him from entering the federal courthouse. His tools and legal files were left outside in the rain at the West Linn property. Macy, the woman who had threatened arson and murder, was left in control of everything he owned.\nIII. OFFICERS EDIT REPORTS IN SYNC\n24. What happened next reveals the conspiracy. Officer Dana Gunnarson prepared her initial arrest report. The report was submitted to her supervisor. The supervisor rejected it—the report did not establish the elements of the charge. This rejection occurred approximately twelve hours before Plaintiff's arraignment. The officers were called in as a team at 7:00 a.m. before the March 7 arraignment to coordinate their stories. They revised and edited their reports. The revised reports were submitted within fifteen minutes of each other—a synchronized fabrication. (ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 29–31; see also ECF 15, Ex. 23 Police Report Timestamps).\n25. The photos do show Macy with the hammer. But the photos were obscured and hidden from Plaintiff by his own defense counsel. He discovered this only after firing her. The photos prove Macy was the armed aggressor—but they were suppressed as exculpatory evidence. (ECF 8 ¶¶ 37–39; ECF 15, Ex. 36.)\n28. The police reports told a different story than reality. The hammer disappeared from the narrative. The seven broken windows were omitted. The three prior 911 calls where Plaintiff was the 911 complainant were not mentioned. The word \"into\" (water sprayed into the windows, onto Plaintiff's property) became \"at\" (water sprayed at the windows, as if Macy were merely watering the garden). The ninety pounds of flour was erased. The three days of arson threats were nowhere to be found. The fridge, the flood, and even the fire threats in other officer reports were ignored here.\nIV. THE ARRAIGNMENT: MARCH 7, 2022\n26. The next morning, March 7, 2022, Plaintiff was arraigned on the misdemeanor charge. Macy Galla appeared at the courthouse—and was caught by security attempting to bring methamphetamine into the courtroom. The drugs were confiscated. She was not arrested; she was not turned away. An asterisk was put on Plaintiff's charge, and no definitive reason was given for why he was arrested outside of the statutes on his information. (See ECF 8 ¶ 48; Court Security Log, Mar. 7, 2022, ECF 35-7 at 3.)\n27. This was the State's sole witness. A woman with methamphetamine use. A woman who had been the subject of three DHS interventions that year—including three psychiatric holds. A woman who would later text Plaintiff: \"They took the girls. And my alimony . . . Wish we got along better.\" (Pre-Arrest JSON, Text Message Log (Aug. 25, 2022).) The District Attorney's office used Macy's coerced cooperation—threatening the custody of her children—to keep Plaintiff detained.\n28. At the arraignment, DDA Rebecca Portlock told the court that Plaintiff was \"high risk,\" had an \"override release\" flag, and had \"two or more felonies\" with a \"violent history.\" This was false. Plaintiff was before the court on a misdemeanor. He had never been in trouble in Oregon. His last legal issue was a DUI in 2013. He did not have two or more felonies. Nothing violent. Ever. But based on these fabricated representations, Plaintiff was denied release on recognizance. The \"override release\" flag reflected a classification decision that overstated his criminal history and risk level and was later used to justify harsher jail conditions.\n29. A No Contact Order was imposed. This meant Plaintiff could not return tothe residence where Macy had destroyed his property, could not retrieve his tools, his legal files, his car keys, his evidence for the AOB case. Everything he needed to prosecute his $111,943.56 civil claim was now inaccessible—held by the same woman the State was using as its witness.\nV. FIRST DETENTION: MARCH 6 – APRIL 12, 2022 (DAY 1-37 DAYS)\n30. Plaintiff was denied saline solution for the infections developing from his months-old contacts. He was denied law library access for extended periods while pro se deadlines approached in his AOB civil case. He had e-filed seven motions in that case in early March 2022; all were now impossible to prosecute.\n31. On April 12, 2022, Plaintiff was released on his own recognizance. (ROR Order.) He stepped out into a world where he had nothing—no car, no clothes, no ID, no legal files.\nVI. RELEASE: APRIL 14, 2022 (HYPOTHERMIA/HOSPITAL)\n32. Two days after release, Plaintiff developed hypothermia. It was still winter. He was soaking wet, wearing only a sleeveless shirt—the only garment available when he was released from jail. It was hailing; he was freezing, searching for clothes or shelter.\n33. An officer stopped Plaintiff, who was trying to warm his hands with a small torch, and seemed concerned about Plaintiff burning himself. He asked if there was someone to call to get clothes. He had him call Macy; the only place he had clothes in the state. Unsuccessful on the clothes, he was taken to a hospital for hypothermia, with body temperature in the low nineties.\n34. Plaintiff never provided his name or identification to the responding officer. Yet the officer obtained Plaintiff's identity—he later claimed he \"heard\" Plaintiff tell the hospital his name, but no such disclosure occurred in the officer's presence. The officer went into the hospital and obtained Plaintiff's identity from hospital staff or medical records.\n35. From the hospital, someone called Macy. Whether it was the officer or hospital staff, the call created the violation that would be used to re-arrest Plaintiff: a No Contact Order violation. Plaintiff was re-arrested on a single no-contact violation charge—not for any contact he initiated, but because an officer obtained his identity from a hospital during a medical emergency and then used that emergency to manufacture a violation.\n36. This was not law enforcement. This was entrapment using protected health information.\n VII. RE-ARREST #2: MAY 6, 2022 (DAY 61-66 COURTHOUSE ARREST)\n37. On May 6, 2022, Plaintiff appeared at Clackamas County Court for a scheduled hearing. He was arrested at the courthouse on the no-contact violation charges arising from the April 14 hypothermia incident.\n38. Bail was set at $10,000. Plaintiff bailed out four days later, on May 10,2022. But the manipulation continued. The jail allowed him to bail out—then later recharged him with the same conduct. They postponed the charge, let the bail process, then recharged as if it were new. This was bail manipulation designed to ensure repeated arrests. (SAC ¶¶ 78–80 (ECF 17-1).)\nVIII. RE-ARREST #3: MAY 24, 2022 (CAR STOP)\n39. Plaintiff was released on May 10. He was out for fourteen days. During this time, Plaintiff was helping a friend recover a stolen vehicle. He was driving the friend's car—with the friend's knowledge and consent. The woman who had stolen the car was a passenger in the vehicle. Plaintiff was taking her to retrieve the license plate she had removed.\n40. On May 24, 2022, police pulled over the vehicle. Plaintiff explained the situation: this is my friend's car; she stole it; we recovered it together; he drove to get it; I was handed the keys and was making a stop to recover possession for my friend since I had things in it too.\n41. The police response: they gave the car keys to the thief. She stole the car again. Plaintiff was arrested and sent back to Clackamas County Jail. Cruiser cam footage exists documenting this arrest. (SAC ¶¶ 82–84 (ECF 17-1).)\nIX. FINAL DETENTION: MAY 24 – JULY 8, 2022 (DAY 77-122)\n42. A. May 24-28, 2022:Forced COVID Exposure: \"Seeding\"; days into this detention, the jail deliberately exposed Plaintiff to COVID-19. On May 28, 2022—with Plaintiff's AOB civil trial set for June 8—jail housing records show Plaintiff was moved \"to COVID block after positive test on 05-28-2022\" and placed in a cell with a COVID-positive inmate. He was told \"6-foot mandatory Covid restrictions.\" This was false: housing logs showed multiple empty beds in non-COVID units and recorded that he was moved to the COVID block the following day, allowing further spread. (Housing Log Screenshot, May 29, 2022.)\n43. The pattern was systematic. Four empty cells, then four double-stacked cells with inmates catching COVID sequentially. Plaintiff's cellmate was David Dahlen—a man who had assaulted an officer and escaped the justice center. The jail wanted Dahlen infected too. First they infected Plaintiff. Then they left Plaintiff in the cell with Dahlen for days until Dahlen contracted the virus. Plaintiff tested positive for COVID on May 28, 2022. The housing book still shows this date—they \"forgot to take it out.\" But the jail removed all of Plaintiff's medical records during the infection period. The absence of those records proves tampering; the proof lies in the fact that they knew Plaintiff was positive during a global pandemic and left him housed with Dahlen for another day, and then moved him into a cell with another inmate, Zac. It cannot be seen that there was another person directly, but it shows Plaintiff refused to get in his cell and went to an open cell—which he should already have had if they were not seeding people with Covid. (ECF 15, Ex. 36; ECF 17-1 ¶¶ 171–72.)\n44. Plaintiff filed a grievance on June 2, 2022, complaining about forced  COVID exposure and dangerous housing conditions. The jail responded five weeks later. The jail's top officer wrote him off as \"unhappy\" when, at the time, he was functionally blind without corrective lenses, had had his documents deleted, and had a grievance pending for both of those things too, and ignored anything he said—on July 5, 2022. With Plaintiff's vision, he could not tell anything besides that the lieutenant was tall, as he could not tell you how many fingers he himself would be holding up at arm's reach. By then, the damage was done: the AOB trial had been missed, the criminal trials had been canceled, and the legal files had been deleted.\n45. June 8, 2022: The AOB Trial That Never Was on the morning of June 8, 2022, Plaintiff was transported toward the Clackamas County Courthouse for his $111,943.56 AOB trial. This was the claim he had been litigating for two years. This was the money the heirs had stolen. This was his day in court. Plaintiff was pulled off the bus. The explanation: one of the officers \"switched hands\" with a test and did not know if they all passed or not, even though Plaintiff had been cleared by medical on June 6, 2022. This story makes no sense; if test results were unclear, retest on the spot. But there was no retest. Instead, Plaintiff was returned to the jail, and his AOB case proceeded without him. On his \"retrial\" he had no claims. The court treated his absence as voluntary non-appearance. The case was dismissed.\nFRAUD UPON THE COURT NUMBER ______ -June 10 2022: Second Criminal Trial:(The COVID Lie)\n46. Plaintiff was not in the courtroom. They removed him as soon as he walked in—before Judge Steele arrived. They did not want him to see the judge, because his presence would ruin their story. What happened in his absence was captured on the transcript that Plaintiff obtained nearly two years later, on April 19, 2024. (48.) DDA Portlock told Judge Steele: \"He tested positive for COVID . . . yesterday.\" (June 10, 2022 Tr. at 3–4, ECF 15, Ex. 1.) Judge Steele immediately responded with something hard to catch on the transcript because both were talking at once: \n\"Apparently he didn't. Apparently he didn't,\" and then, \n\"Mr.. Medina . . .\"—referring to defense advisor Rubin Medina the court had assigned Plaintiff. Judge Steele continued: \n\"The information I got from you yesterday was that he failed for the last two days.\" She said: \"The information I got from you yesterday.\"\n47. \"Yesterday\" was June 9. There had been an ex parte meeting—a communication between officers of the court without the pro se litigant present. This is a constitutional violation. Plaintiff had a right to be present for any proceeding affecting his case. Moreover, Plaintiff had just walked into the courtroom and heard the DDA squeal, \"Get him out of here before the judge sees him!\" fifteen minutes prior. In addition, Medina had visited Plaintiff the day before and knew he was in general population.\n48. Judge Steele corrected the record in full: \"It turns out he didn't. He didn't test positive yesterday . . . . It turns out that he tested positive on May 29th [twelve days earlier] and . . . he got out of quarantine . . . and was put into the general population.\" (June 10, 2022 Tr. at 6–8, ECF 15, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff was present, cleared, and ready for trial. The prosecutor and defense advisor had given coordinated false statements to the court. The judge acknowledged the falsity on the record and said, \"Because of that I called the jury off.\"\n49. Consequently the trial was postponed. The day before—June 9—Macy had dropped off a letter at the court. She said the situation was \"felt endangered\" She was leaving the country. She felt in danger. She told Plaintiff's mother \"they were making her choose.\" She left the country on June 9. If the State's sole witness felt that pressured, something was not right..\n50. This is fraud upon the court under Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 246 (1944): intentional fraud by officers of the court, directed at the court itself, which deceived the court. All four elements are satisfied.\nJUNE 20, 2022: SIXTY-TWO LEGAL FILES DELETED\nAt exactly 5:10 p.m. on June 20, 2022—during mandatory dinner lock  down (after being denied law library 6 days in a row) when all inmates were confined to cells with no witnesses—jail guard Baker accessed the law library computer system and deleted sixty-two of Plaintiff's legal files:  \nJUNE 24, 2022: THE STATE'S WITNESS FINALLY SPEAKS—\n51. And Destroys the States case June 24, 2022, was the first time Macy Galla ever gave a statement in this case. The officers' arrest reports were fabricated from the kids' photographs and their own coordination—no witness statement had ever been taken from Macy at the scene. She went inside and closed the door. Now, for the first time, she was under oath.\n52. Macy testified and after the DDA announced the history of the case Macy  stated: \"Yes, half of that was untrue, fabricated, and manipulated . ... “ followed by “[Plaintiff] have[has] committed no crimes.\" (June 24, 2022, Tr. at 7–8, ECF 15, Ex. 2.) (56.) She testified that DDA Portlock had threatened to take her children if she did not cooperate—\"SHE took my children.\" She explained that DHS leverage had been used to coerce her testimony. Plaintiff's attorney at the time called Macy \"mental\"—an accurate description, as she had been placed on three separate psychiatric holds that same year. But the characterization meant she would not testify again. Previous statements had included that she wanted to marry Plaintiff. She was a loose cannon.\n53. The State's case had collapsed. Their sole witness had recanted. She had called the prosecutor a liar. She had denied any criminal conduct by Plaintiff. Under any reasonable standard, the prosecution should have ended that day. It did not. DDA Portlock continued the prosecution for another nineteen days.\nJULY 1, 2022: ORDERED RELEASED, BUT NOT RELEASED\n54. On July 1, 2022, the judge signed a release order. Plaintiff should have walked out that day. The court had claimed Plaintiff violated a few more no-contact orders and on July 1st held a hearing for all of them. Time served. However, the jail refused to process the order—for seven days. By July 8,\n55. Plaintiff remained in custody in direct violation of a court order. The jail cited \"awaiting DA clearance\"—which is not a legitimate requirement for compliance with a judicial release order. Later Plaintiff found they had the copies the entire time—they were intentionally overlooking it or the jail knowingly and recklessly left cognitively incapable people in charge of the freedom of people they housed. And in Plaintiff's case multiple times this resulted in unlawful holds. A release order is an order. The jail has no authority to require additional \"clearance\" from the District Attorney before complying. That day, Macy screamed at DDA Portlock in the courtroom: \"FUCK YOU DA!!!!\" and slammed the door.\nJULY 8, 2022: RELEASE TO HOMELESSNESS\n56. Plaintiff was finally released on July 8, 2022. Total days in custody: 129 was twenty-five times longer than the five-day plea offer he had rejected. Because he was innocent.\n57. When he walked out, he had nothing. His AOB case was dismissed. His property was pillage d and destroyed. He was homeless.\nI. JULY 14, 2022: (DISMISSED NIGHT BEFORE)\n58. The dismissal came exactly one day before Plaintiff would have had a jurytrial—the first opportunity for twelve citizens to hear what actually happened on March 4–6, 2022. The State could not risk that.\nX. STATE COURT: (NOVEMBER 2022 – MAY 2024)\n59. On November 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed Case No. 22CV39627 in Clackamas County Circuit Court—a civil rights action. They were all served by November 28th 2022\n60. Clackamas County and its related entities were served 13 times on the register County Submitted in this federal court. Yet they never showed up. They never answered. (ECF 35-4.)—However they were able to file a “repetitive” lawsuit defense. \n61. On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Appearance. Seven days later, on April 11, 2023, the state court dismissed some of the defendants that Plaintiff was trying to change the name, (thinking it was his fault they didn’t show) \"for want of prosecution\" by Plaintiff. (ECF 35-2, 35-3 (Limited Dismissal Orders).) The defendants who had been actively hiding for six months were rewarded.\n62. The court sent notices under UTCR 7 (not 7.020) that Plaintiff had \"not provided proof of service for at least one defendant.\" The notices did not identify which defendant. They did not cite the specific rule. They did not explain the 28-day cure period. When notices came back, the fields were blank—no addressee information, no signature, no confirmation of delivery. Plaintiff filed service proofs on March 31 and April 3, 2023—within any reasonable cure window. The dismissals came seven days after his Motion to Compel, without hearing. (See ECF 67 Exs.18–24, 3-9-2023 notices and ORS 18.078; ECF 35-4.)\n63. Plaintiff exhausted appeal on March 7, 2024—exactly two years after the false arrest would have become unreachable against the officers—after Plaintiff could not get a waiver of the undertaking of costs from Clackamas County. The Oregon Supreme Court, after accepting the appeal, dismissed it without ruling on the merits for lack of the undertaking, despite two waiver requests. (See Records Request and appellate correspondence, 22CR10908 Court Records Request, April 19, 2024; CASEFILE 22C109081.pdf.) (1) One hundred eleven thousand, nine hundred forty-three dollars and fifty-six cents—earned, invoiced, approved, and paid—was gone because of a fabricated COVID excuse on the morning of trial. (2) The heirs then obtained a $32,599.50 counter-judgment against Plaintiff. He was not present to defend himself. He could not be present. The jail made sure of that.\n64. At the same time, the basic records needed to prove this fraud were effectively priced out of reach. The court reporter for the AOB case quoted Plaintiff $3.00 per page, or $1,050 in advance for an estimated 350-page transcript, before any work would begin (Transcript Estimate of Tammy Rampone, June 12, 2023). The Oregon Judicial Department later quoted $637.50 to search six hours of internal court emails concerning communications between Judge Steele and advisor Medina about Plaintiff's case, denying any fee waiver on the ground that Plaintiff's request was merely a \"private concern.\" (OJD Public Records Response, Records Request No. R000023-013025, Feb. 6, 2025.) Those costs imposed while Plaintiff was indigent, homeless, and still trying to salvage his AOB appeal, made it practically impossible to obtain the very transcripts and internal communications that would have exposed the misconduct and preserved his claims.\nBad Notice and the Missing UTCR 7.020 “Day 91” Step: There Was never a Proper State Court Dismissal for “Want of Prosecution.”\n65. The limited dismissals of the County defendants in 22CV39627 were not the product of a functioning state procedure; they were entered on the back of facially defective notices that violated ORS 18.078, UTCR 7.020, and basic due process. Those defects matter because ECF 60 treated the state dismissals as if they were clean “want of prosecution” rulings. They were not.\n66. 1. The March 9, 2023, UTCR 7 Notice Was Generic and Useless\n67. On March 9, 2023, the court mailed a form “Notice of Intent to Dismiss –63 Day” under UTCR 7, stating only:\n68. “You have not provided the court with proof of service for at least onedefendant in this case.”\n69. and warning that any “unserved defendants” would be dismissed in 28 days“for want of prosecution” unless service was shown, good cause was filed, or the defendant appeared. (Notice dated Mar. 9, 2023, Ex. 18 & Ex. 20.)\n70. The notice never identified which defendant was supposedly unserved. Bythat point, multiple proofs of service were already on file, including:\n71. • Returns for West Linn, Blyth, Gunnarson, and DDA Portlock; and\n72. Service on the Jail via ORCP 7 D(2) “office service” on Lt. McCullough on\n73. March 31, 2023, with follow up mailing on April 3, 2023. (Certificate of Service\n74. “serve april 3.pdf,” Ex. 5.)\n75. The only parties who had truly never appeared were the John Doe officers,who by definition could not be named until discovery against the County/Jail occurred. A notice that says “at least one defendant” with no name, no case specific explanation, and no reference to the actual register entries is not “reasonably calculated” to tell a pro se litigant what needs to be cured. See\n76. Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314–15 (1950). (77.) Six days later, on March 15, 2023, the court sent a second one line “Notice of Signed Document” telling Appellant only that “a case event that includes a signed document has been added to the Register of Actions” and instructing him to log into OECI or use a courthouse kiosk to see what it was. (Notice of Signed Document, Mar. 15, 2023, Ex. 19; see also OJD email, Ex. 220.) For a legally blind pro se litigant without ready OECI access, which was not meaningful notice of anything, let alone an impending dismissal.\n77. 2. The April 11 and May 11, 2023, Judgment Notices Violated ORS\n78. 18.078\n79. Despite the outstanding service proofs and a pending Motion to Compel\n80. Appearance filed April 4, 2023, the court entered a “Judgment – Limited Dismissal” on April 11, 2023, dismissing County side parties “for want of prosecution.” The April 11 ORS 18.078 notice reads:\n81. “The court entered a judgment – Limited Dismissal in the court register on\n82. 04/11/2023. This judgment does NOT create a lien.”\n83. and lists “Monetary Award Type: None / Award Amount: $0.00,” directing\n84. Appellant only to “see judgment for further details.” (Notice of Entry of\n85. Judgment dated Apr. 11, 2023, Ex. 22.)\n86. On May 11, 2023, the court mailed another “Notice of Entry of Judgment”that was even more defective. On the critical line it states:\n87. “The court entered in the court register on ______.”\n88. leaving both the judgment type and the date of entry completely blank, andagain listing “Award Amount: $0.00.” (Notice dated May 11, 2023, Ex. 24.) (84.) Yet ORS 18.078(2) requires that a notice of entry of judgment in a civil action “must reflect”:\n89. “[t]he date the judgment was entered,” and\n90. “[w]hether the judgment was entered as a limited judgment, a generaljudgment or a supplemental judgment.” (Statutory text, Ex. 23.)\n91. The May 11 notice satisfies neither requirement. A notice that does not saywhen the judgment was entered or what kind of judgment it is cannot start deadlines, support an assumption that Plaintiff “knew” what had been decided, or provide any basis for later AIU abstention. It is, under Mullane and Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84–86 (1988), the kind of “mere gesture” that does not comport with due process.\n92. 3. The UTCR 7.020 “Day 91 / Not at Issue” and Default Track Was\n93. Skipped Entirely\n94. Under UTCR 7.020(3), once a civil case reaches Day 91 after filing withoutall parties at issue, the court is supposed to:\n95. deem the case “not at issue”;\n96. send written notice that identifies the problem; and\n97. open a 28 day window in which the plaintiff can either cure or seek adefault judgment.\n98. Here, that step never happened in a meaningful way. Instead, the court:\n99. issued the bulk form March 9 “at least one defendant” notice with no names\n100. (Ex. 18, 20);\n101. (93.) followed it with a kiosk only “signed document” note on March 15 (Ex.\n102. 19);\n103. entered “Digitized Judgment – Limited Dismissal” on April 11 while the\n104. Motion to Compel was pending; and\n105. mailed the May 11 blank field ORS 18.078 notice (Ex. 24) instead of a proper\n106. Day 91 UTCR 7.020 notice and default opportunity.\n107. By the time these defective notices were issued, Appellant had already:\n108. personally, served the Jail on March 31 and mailed on April 3\n109. (Ex. 5);\n110. filed the Motion to Compel on April 4; and\n111. been pursuing discovery and motions continuously, as the stateregister shows (ECF 35 4).\n112. The combined effect was to cut off the very default mechanism UTCR7.020 is supposed to afford when defendants stonewall appearance. That is exactly the kind of “state created procedural remedy” the Supreme Court held was protected by due process in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422,\n113. 433–37 (1982): when the State fails to follow its own established procedure, and the claimant loses his case as a result, the Constitution is violated.\n114. 4. For a Legally Blind Litigant, Kiosk Only and Blank Notices Were an\n115. Access to Courts Violation\n116. The notice defects were compounded by Appellant’s disability. He islegally blind (−11/−12 diopters) and was, during much of this period, either in custody or indigent. (See disability documentation and IFP application, Ex. 125–128.) The court’s March 15 OECI only instruction (Ex. 19), the reliance on kiosks, and the refusal of the federal clerk’s office later in May 2024 to accept filings by email or thumb drive (Clerk Oss emails, Ex. H) together meant that: (98.) The only channels through which Appellant could learn what had happened or file timely papers were effectively closed to him; and\n117. The state system never offered reasonable accommodations for his visualimpairment.\n118. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 523–32 (2004), holds that access to thecourts is a fundamental right and that states must make reasonable modifications so disabled litigants can exercise that right. Here, instead of accommodation, Appellant received generic, incomplete, or kiosk only notices that he could not meaningfully use.\n119. 5. Consequences for AIU and the “Repetitive Lawsuit” Narrative (102.) Taken together, these notice defects mean there was never a procedurally valid “want of prosecution” dismissal of the County/Jail defendants:\n120. The March 9 UTCR 7 notice never identified which defendant was atissue.\n121. The March 15 “signed document” notice only pointed to OECI, with nosubstance.\n122. The April 11 limited judgment was entered while a Motion to Compel\n123. County’s appearance was pending.\n124. The May 11 ORS 18.078 notice omitted the date of entry and the judgmenttype altogether.\n125. A plaintiff who is actively serving defendants, filing a Motion to Compel,and litigating discovery is not “failing to prosecute.” When the court uses anonymous, non compliant notices to clear out non appearing government defendants, the resulting “judgment” cannot be treated as a clean, merits based resolution for purposes of AIU abstention or res judicata.\n126. At a minimum, the “bad notice” record is a compelling reason why theNinth Circuit should reject ECF 60’s characterization that the state case was properly “dismissed for failure to prosecute,” and why the state forum cannot be deemed adequate for AIU.\n127. C. West Linn–Driven Delay: August–December 2023\n128. From August through December 2023, the state court record shows that itwas West Linn and the court—not Appellant—who controlled the calendar and repeatedly pushed the case into the limitations window.\n129. 1. August 2, 2023 – Emergency Motion and Show Cause Filings\n130. On August 2, 2023, Appellant filed an “Emergency Motion for InterimRelief” and a “Motion – Show Cause (Interim Relief)”, followed on August 12 by a “Memorandum – At Law (Emergency Motion for Interim Relief)”, and on\n131. August 22 by a “Motion for Expedited Hearing”. (State register entries dated\n132. 08/02/2023 and 08/12/2023; 08/22/2023 motion for expedited hearing.)\nAugust 25, 2023 – Counsel’s Notice of Unavailability Freezes the Calendar\n133. On August 25, 2023, West Linn’s trial attorney, William Stabler, filed a“Counsel’s Notice of Unavailability” stating that he “will be out of the office and unavailable from Monday, August 28, 2023 to Friday, September 15, 2023,” and further “requested that no motions, hearings, or depositions be set during this period, and that a minimum of two weeks be allowed to respond or reply to any matters following the undersigned’s return.” (Counsel’s Notice of Unavailability and Certificate of Service.)\n134. The state register for 22CV39627 reflects on that same date: “Counsel’sNotice of Unavailability.”\n135. 3. October 12 & 20, 2023 – Show Cause Denied; Hearing Reset from October 23 to November 20\n136. On October 11, 2023, Judge Wetzel entered an “Order – Denial (showcause – Denied)” with respect to Appellant’s emergency motion; the order was docketed October 12, 2023.\n137. Shortly thereafter, the October 23, 2023, hearing on “M/Relief” beforeJudge Schroer was “CANCELED… Continued” on the register.\n138. On October 20, 2023, the court issued a Notice of Scheduled CourtAppearance setting a “Hearing – Motion” for November 20, 2023, at 9:00 AM, and expressly noting that it was “M/Relief reset from 10/23/23 due to conflict for\n139. Judge Schroer.”\n140. 4. October 24–26, 2023 – Appellant Warns of Looming Limitations;\n141. West Linn Opposes Any Ex Parte Relief\n142. On October 24, 2023, Appellant emailed Stabler explaining that he hadalready flown in for what he understood to be an emergency setting—“They waited too long for my [hearing] I was already committed on my flight”—and that he would be going to ex parte because of statutes of limitation and the failure to schedule his emergency motion.\n143. In follow up messages the same day, Appellant told Stabler that “statutesof limitations [are] coming up within a few months,” that the court would not schedule a timely emergency motion, and that “I am going to be in Ex Partee TOMORROW… I really need it to go through or I’m going to lose about everything.”\n144. Stabler responded on October 24 and 26, 2023 that “the hearing for yourmotion is set for November 20 and I object to you having any ex parte contact with the court on any issue in this case.”\n145. Appellant replied that he was “being encroached by statutes of limitations,the inability to comply with Undertakings of cost, and personal relationships and my wellness,” and that having to wait until November 20 after counsel’s unavailability would be “unfair.”\n146. 5. November 2–14, 2023 – West Linn Moves to Setover Trial and\n147. Settlement Conference; Postponement Granted\n148. On November 2, 2023, West Linn filed “Defendants West Linn PoliceDepartment, Dana Gunnarson and Catlin Blyth’s Motion to Setover Trial Date and Settlement Conference.” The motion certified under UTCR 6.030(2) that counsel had advised his clients and that they agreed to the postponement, stating that the January 9, 2024 trial date should be moved because “Defendant Catlin\n149. Blyth will be on leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (‘FMLA’) until\n150. January 31, 2024, due to the expected birth of a child.”\n151. The motion asked that trial be reset to “March 19, 2024; April 2, 2024;May 14, 2024; or May 21, 2024” and noted that “Plaintiff objects to the requested postponement.”\n152. That same day, Stabler lodged an Order on Motion to Setover Trial Dateand Settlement Conference, and a Certificate of Readiness stating that the proposed order was “ready for judicial signature” and that service/objection requirements had been met.\n153. On November 14, 2023, Judge Wetzel entered an “Order – Postponement\n154. (Granted)” granting the continuance.\n155. 6. December 13–15, 2023 – Trial Moved from January 9, 2024, to\n156. May 21, 2024; Interim Relief Finally Denied\n157. On December 13, 2023, the court issued a Notice of Scheduled Court\n158. Appearance to West Linn’s counsel setting “Trial – Twelve Person Jury” for May\n159. 21, 2024, at 9:00 AM, with the additional note: “Reset from 1/9/24; Mo/Co\n160. MCW.” The state register likewise reflects “CANCELED Trial – Twelve Person\n161. Jury (9:00 AM) … Continued,” for January 9, 2024, and a new trial setting on May 21, 2024.\n162. On December 15, 2023, the court entered an “Order Denying Plaintiff’sMotion for Interim Relief and Defendants’ Cross Motion for Attorney Fees”, with a signed date of December 13, 2023.\n163. Trial was set for January 9, 2024. On November 2, 2023, the court granted\n164. West Linn's Motion to Setover Trial. The reason: Officer Blyth's paternity leave.\n165. The trial was reset to May 21, 2024. (ECF 35-1, Ex. 6 (Order on Motion to\n166. Setover Trial Date and Settlement Conference); Ex. 12 (Notice of Scheduled Jury Trial, Dec. 13, 2023).) Plaintiff opposed the setover.. He purchased two plane tickets to attend hearings. He wanted this case tried. The reset was granted anyway. This was the last document Plaintiff Filed in Clackamas County Court case for this case until the dismissal. Besides two telephone calls, and the email when they canceled trial again. Here William scheduled this trial in December and that means he knew he was having a baby and did it anyways… then dumped the case on Lewis. (West Linns Partners)\n167. The May 21, 2024, trial was then reset again due to defense counselStabler's scheduling conflicts. Trial slid further. Each time, the delay was attributed to Plaintiff. But the record shows otherwise. (ECF 35-4.)\n168. IN SUMM:\n169. The Opinion states that Plaintiff \"only began attempting to remove his case to federal court the day Clackamas was dismissed. The Opinion states that Plaintiff \"only began attempting to remove his case to federal court the day before the state court's first trial setting,\" and that his attempted removal \"resulted in the cancelation of his state court trial.\" (ECF 60 at 11.) The actual record tells a different story, but it’s very likely Judge Beckerman didn’t read any of it…\n170. May 7, 2024: Plaintiff emailed defense counsel: \"I'm going to be filing in\n171. Federal Court this afternoon or tomorrow . . .\" and asked for their position. (ECF 67, Ex. 9 (\"WILLIAM GOING TO FEDERAL COURT.pdf\").) Defendants were\n172. on notice sixteen days before any filing.\n173. May 13, 2024: Federal clerk Eric Oss rejected Plaintiff's attempt to file byemail: \"Our Local Rules do not authorize us to take a complaint by email from a pro se party.\" (ECF 67, Ex. H, 5-13-2024 email.)\n174. May 18, 2024: The state register records: \"per atty Lewis, pet filed motionto remove to fed court on 5.18.\" (ECF 35-4.) Plaintiff never spoke to the court; defense counsel did. That notation is Lewis's statement, not Plaintiff's filing.\n175. May 20, 2024: Lewis filed a lengthy pretrial motion in state court—the daybefore trial—then the calendaring clerk emailed all counsel: \"Due to the length of the defense's pre-trial motion in addition to the motion over this past weekend by plaintiff to move the case to federal court, it has been determined that this case is not ready for trial tomorrow and is being re-set.\" (ECF 67, Ex. 3.) The clerk put the primary blame where it belonged: on the defense's last-minute motion.\n176. May 22, 2024: Plaintiff tried again to file federally, this time delivering a thumbdrive and paper to the clerk's office. Oss responded: \"We received what you sent, but it cannot be accepted for filing . . .. The Clerk's Office will not pull or sort documents from thumb drives or loose envelopes . . .. No action can be taken on your submissions received by mail today.\" (ECF 67, Ex. H, 5-22-2024 email.) • May 23, 2024: Only after all of that did the federal complaint finally hit the docket.\n177. Thus, trial was already canceled by a combination of Lewis's pretrial motion and the clerk's internal decisions before any federal case number existed. ECF 60 simply repeated defense counsel's story and wrote Plaintiff out of his own timeline.\n178. lackamas was dismissed..,\" and that his attempted removal \"resulted in the cancelation of his state court trial.\" (ECF 60 at 11.) The actual record tells a different story.\n"

By Oregon law, County could no show, in hopes that Plaintiff doesn't file the proper Default Application, they acan send notice on a link via bulk email, and if Plaintiff does catch it, they can then show up with no penalty, however if they do not they get to call \"repetative\" Prejudice against a Plaintiff who now has to start over to and serve you for another dozen times? for their intentional obstruction? Does this even need to be argued? (The state court register shows that Clackamas County was served approximately fifteen times but never answered, never moved, and never appeared. ECF 35-4.

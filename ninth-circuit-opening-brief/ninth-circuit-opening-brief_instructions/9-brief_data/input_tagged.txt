=== INTRODUCTION ===
Appellees move to dismiss this appeal on a single, factually incorrect premise: that Appellant’s Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment (Rule 59(e)) was untimely, and therefore failed to toll the deadline to file a Notice of Appeal.
This argument is foreclosed by the District Court’s own finding. In its October 8, 2025 Order (ECF No. 65), the District Court explicitly acknowledged that Appellant “timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.”
Because the tolling motion was timely filed on October 1, 2025, the deadline to appeal did not begin to run until the District Court disposed of that motion on October 3, 2025. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025—well within the 30-day window. Accordingly, jurisdiction is proper, and the Motion to Dismiss must be denied.

=== JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ===
STATEMENT OF JURISDICTIONAL FACTS
1. September 3, 2025: The District Court entered Judgment dismissing the case (ECF No. 60).
2. October 1, 2025 (The Deadline): Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), the deadline to file a motion to alter or amend was 28 days later: October 1, 2025.
3. October 1, 2025 at 11:57 PM: Appellant submitted his Rule 59(e) motion via the CM/ECF system. The system generated a receipt confirming the document was received on this date. See Exhibit A (CM/ECF Receipt timestamped 11:57 PM). Due to a clerical error during the electronic submission process, the document was routed to the related, remanded case number (3:24-cv-00838-SB) rather than the active case number (3:24-cv-00839-SB).
4. October 2, 2025 at 1:06 AM: Just 66 minutes past the midnight deadline, Appellant realized the routing error and emailed all defense counsel the full motion and 29 exhibits, providing actual notice. See Exhibit B (Email to Counsel dated Oct 2, 2025, 1:06 AM).
5. October 3, 2025: The District Court entered an order denying the Rule 59(e) motion on its merits (ECF No. 63).
6. October 8, 2025: In a subsequent order (ECF No. 65), Magistrate Judge Beckerman made a specific factual finding regarding the October 1 submission: “...he timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.”
7. October 13, 2025: Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 66/67).

1) I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
The district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over this civil rights action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3)–(4) because Appellant Tyler Allen Lofall brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. On Sept 3, 2025, Judgement was made in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Portland Division, entered a final judgment in Case No. 3:24-cv-00839-SB that disposed of all claims and all parties. Appellant notified the parties the morning of October first, then filed a timely Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment in the district court. In ECF No. 60, the court expressly found that Appellant “timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.” However, corrected it in 66 minutes in addition to the prior notice. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), that timely Rule 59(e) motion tolled the time to appeal. Appellant then filed a notice of appeal on October 14, 2025, within the time allowed by Rule 4(a) as tolled. See Fed. R. App. P. 3, 4(a)(1)(A), 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

2) II. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS INVOLVED
First Amendment violated: Removed from courtroom, pro se trials, ex parte communications, filing barriers for blind litigant, and due to the malicious prosecution and unlawful arrest Appellant has been deprived of ever having his day in court.
Fourth Amendment violated: False arrest based on fabricated probable cause (March 6, 2022).
Sixth Amendment violated: Court-appointed advisor coordinated with DDA to give false COVID information, canceling trial (June 10, 2022). Legal files deleted, law library denied, corrective lenses withheld, undermined by his advisor, and had his own court appointed attorney withhold evidence and make decisions on Appellant’s behalf with explicit contradictory instructions.
Seventh Amendment violated: AOB civil trial proceeded without Plaintiff, while unlawfully detained (June 8, 2022). State civil rights case never reached trial—County never appeared. Federal case dismissed without trial.
Fourteenth Amendment violated: Held seven days past release order. Defective notices with blank fields. Federal dismissal timed to Day 181—closing both forums simultaneously, judged without proper review on a non-jurisdictional argument for lack of jurisdiction.
Ninth Amendment violated: Every procedural doctrine—immunity, abstention, time-bar, forum shopping—has been weaponized to crush Plaintiff's substantive rights. “The ‘enumeration’ of certain rights has been construed to deny and disparage other rights retained by the people.”

III. THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY REMAINS LIVE AND WITHIN THE COURT’S ARTICLE III JURISDICTION.
Under United States v. Dae Rim Fishery Co., 794 F.2d 1392, 1395 (9th Cir. 1986), a document is deemed filed when it is placed in the actual or constructive custody of the clerk, regardless of subsequent clerical errors. The District Court explicitly found in its order dated October 8, 2025 (ECF 65) that Appellant "timely filed the motion but in the wrong case." This factual finding is dispositive. Because the motion was "timely filed" on October 1, 2025, it triggered the tolling provisions of Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). The time to file the Notice of Appeal did not begin to run until the District Court entered the order disposing of the Rule 59(e) motion on October 3, 2025 (ECF 63). The new 30-day deadline expired on November 2, 2025. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025, well within the timely period.

=== ISSUES PRESENTED ===
I. Jurisdiction. Whether the district court's explicit finding that the Rule 59(e) motion was "timely filed" (ECF 65) triggers appellate tolling under United States v. Dae Rim Fishery Co., defeating Appellees' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
II. Repetitive lawsuit doctrine. Whether the district court erred in dismissing the federal action as a "repetitive lawsuit" when the state forum was rendered unavailable through systemic obstruction, including the evasion of service by defendants and the dismissal of the state case for "want of prosecution" while motions to compel were pending.
III. Judicial abdication. Whether a district court violates due process when it adopts the defendants' narrative verbatim while ignoring documented record evidence of fraud—including the "covid lie," the "15-minute report synchronization," and the "consent-then-flip" strategy—thereby engaging in judicial abdication.
IV. Ninth Amendment. Whether the Ninth Amendment's prohibition against construing the "enumeration" of rights to "deny or disparage" others prohibits the use of procedural immunity doctrines to shield bad-faith administrative acts.
V. Can a court ignore documented fraud on the record when it affects substantial rights?
VI. Does the act of avoiding accountability by hiding requirements needed for prosecuting a plaintiff's claim toll the statute?
VII. In a case with multiple defendants that could be subject to a notice, is the notice void without the subject's name?
VIII. Property lost due to a warrantless arrest, such as claim rights to an irrevocable assignment of benefits—does the arresting party have any responsibility if that harm complicates or creates a high probability of failure of remedy due to procedural complexity?

=== STATEMENT OF THE CASE ===
I. THE ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS AND THE THEFT THAT STARTED EVERYTHING
1. In mid-2020, homeowner Joanna Lee Bozian executed an irrevocable Assignment of Benefits in favor of Plaintiff Tyler Lofall for insurance proceeds arising from fire damage to her residence in Damascus, Oregon. The AOB stated in relevant part: "For good and valuable consideration received, I, Joanna Lee Bozian irrevocably transfer and assign to Tyler Lofall . . . all cash values, proceeds and benefits arising thereunder." (ECF 8, Ex. D at 11–12.) The assignment further acknowledged that "an estimated 90% of the fire claim stated above has been completed and all work completed at the property has been completed by Tyler Lofall." Id. By October 2020, Plaintiff had completed all contracted repair work. The claim was submitted, approved by Assurant Insurance Company, and paid in the amount of $111,943.56. (ECF 8, Ex. D at 52.)
2. The homeowner died. Her daughter and son-in-law—the "heirs"—had not visited the property in twenty years. They contacted the mortgage company and fraudulently convinced JP Morgan that Plaintiff had created the AOB through fraud. They removed Plaintiff's deposit information and inserted their own. (ECF 8, Ex. D at 208.) On November 24, 2020, heir Zac Bond emailed Plaintiff: "Get out of the house, and we will get you money immediately." (ECF 8, Ex. 6.) This was a ruse. After the mortgage inspection passed and funds were cleared for release on November 30, 2020, the very next day—December 1, 2020—the heirs reversed course entirely: "If you want money from the insurance claim, you will need to file a claim against Jolie's estate like any other creditor." (ECF 8, Ex. D at 132, lines 611–12.) Plaintiff reported this theft to the Clackamas County District Attorney and Sheriff. Both declined to investigate. The DA's office pointed to the Sheriff's Office; the Sheriff's Office told Plaintiff it was "a civil matter." (ECF 8 ¶¶ 8–9.) This official abandonment forced Plaintiff into civil litigation to recover funds he had already earned. He filed Case No. 21CV02575 in Clackamas County Circuit Court in January 2021, proceeding pro se because the heirs' theft had left him indigent. Trial was eventually set for June 8, 2022. Plaintiff would never see that trial. The heirs' theft had set off a chain of events that would cost Plaintiff not only the $111,943.56, but his freedom, his property, his home, and five years of his life.

II. THE WLPD-COACHED ATTACK: MARCH 4–6, 2022
3. Plaintiff was staying with a West Linn friend, "Macy" Galla, who insisted on him staying there until he finished with his civil claim, since he had already moved his belongings back to Washington and was constantly being called back to court for the AOB case. Due to a combination of Covid, not being paid, his property being spread out from new indigency and the rough departure from Damascus, Plaintiff's current setup in Washougal had no internet and was really just a place to leave things and "sort of" have an eye on them that was closer (three hours closer than Lofall, Washington, where he is from). Because he was from out of state, he needed access to internet (not available in Washougal), and Covid-mandated demands and gaps in hearings made it so Plaintiff had large compilations that his basic laptop was not handling with Adobe.
4. In early March, Macy—annoyed that Plaintiff was spending all his time on his claim and not paying attention to her—snapped when, on the day Plaintiff finished all seven motions he needed before trial, they were returned because his Master Exhibit List did not link directly to the motions. A simple citation was not good enough, nor was the table of contents linked to positions in the master list, which was done. Macy lost it, allegedly stemming from jealousy and substance abuse (backed later by March 7th events). She then took, or had in her possession, Plaintiff's car keys and his AOB work files—contract documents, evidence, and work records critical to his $111,943.56 claim. She irrationally would not return them.
5. Macy wanted Plaintiff to leave without these things; and as cars do not move without keys, when that did not happen on March 4th, Macy called the West Linn Police Department and asked how to evict him. The answer she received was clear: (a) she could not execute a one-day eviction; and (b) legal process was required.
6. A. WLPD dispatch logs and Plaintiff's many statements—messages, police reports, and 911 call logs—agree on what followed.
7. Rather than following lawful eviction procedures, Macy orchestrated a staged arrest with the apparent coaching of law enforcement. (See ECF 8 ¶¶ 37–44; ECF 15, Ex. 36.)
8. March 3, 2022. Macy sent Plaintiff a series of text messages while Plaintiff asked for his keys nine times, and Macy made her intentions explicit: "Come Sunday. Fire it is."; "Burn all your shit too." (See ECF 15, Ex. 36 (Pre-Arrest Text Messages).)
9. March 4, 2022. After learning she could not simply evict Plaintiff and after hanging up on WLPD twice saying she was going to "burn down the house," Macy escalated. (See ECF 8 ¶ 34; ECF 15, Ex. 36.) She went out and purchased five gallons of gasoline. She returned to the property. She took a hammer and dropped a bag at the window over Plaintiff's bed outside, and started with the door, breaking glass: she smashed out seven windows; shattered the door; poured thirty pounds of flour over Plaintiff's bed, tools, clothes, and electronics—the first of three consecutive days of this destruction; cut the power, the heat, and the lights in freezing March temperatures; ran in and tipped the fridge over; and took a garden hose and flooded the inside of the house, spraying the TV, the electronics, the walls—anything she could—and turning everything into a paste. (See ECF 8 ¶¶ 37–44; ECF 15, Ex. 36 (WLPD Incident Report, Mar. 4, 2022).)
10. Plaintiff called 911. He was the complainant—the victim—reporting criminal conduct. West Linn Police Department officers responded: they observed the broken windows; they documented the gasoline purchase and the arson threats; and they took no action against Macy. She was screaming and carrying five gallons of gasoline, running around the yard when they showed up. Despite her written threats to burn the house down, and despite Plaintiff asking them to take her to the hospital, they did nothing. (See ECF 15, Ex. 36; ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 22–27.)
11. March 5, 2022 (Morning). Macy continued her rampage. She poured another thirty pounds of flour over Plaintiff's property—sixty pounds total over two days. Officer Goode responded in the morning. He finally confiscated the five gallons of gasoline that his colleagues had left with Macy the day before. He still did not arrest Macy. He left her at the property with Plaintiff's belongings—and the hammer—still inside. (ECF 17-1, SAC ¶¶ 37–44.)
12. March 5, 2022 (2:24 p.m.). That afternoon, Macy sent Plaintiff a series of text messages that would prove critical to understanding the premeditated nature of what followed: "Expect to [lose] heat and electricity again"; "Windows brake. By themselves. All the time."; "Acetone is a good flame starter"; "I have plenty of that"; "Cars catch on fire all the time"; "If your gone your stuff is safe"; "If you think to stay nothing is safe and no one"; "I would rather kill you then myself"; "I will kill us all first"; "I wish you were dead"; "Die." (Pre-Arrest JSON, Text Message Log (Mar. 5, 2022, 2:24–2:36 p.m.), ECF 15, Ex. 36.)

=== ARGUMENT I ===
THE DISTRICT COURT’S FINDING THAT THE MOTION WAS “TIMELY FILED” IS DISPOSITIVE.
Appellees ask this Court to ignore the District Court’s own assessment of the record. In ECF No. 65, the District Court denied nunc pro tunc relief on procedural grounds but expressly validated the timeliness of the physical act of filing: “...because he timely filed the motion but in the wrong case.”
A filing is deemed "filed" when it is placed in the possession of the clerk. See United States v. Dae Rim Fishery Co., 794 F.2d 1392, 1395 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that a complaint is filed when it is placed in the actual or constructive custody of the clerk, regardless of subsequent clerical errors). Appellant placed the motion in the custody of the CM/ECF system on October 1, 2025. The District Court acknowledged this fact. Therefore, the motion was timely.

=== ARGUMENT II ===
A TIMELY RULE 59(e) MOTION TOLLS THE APPEAL DEADLINE REGARDLESS OF DOCKETING ERRORS.
Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of a timely Rule 59 motion.
• Step 1: The Rule 59 motion was timely filed on October 1, 2025 (per ECF 65 and Dae Rim Fishery).
• Step 2: The appeal deadline was tolled until the Court disposed of that motion.
• Step 3: The Court disposed of the motion on October 3, 2025 (ECF No. 63).
• Step 4: The new 30-day deadline to appeal began on October 3, 2025, expiring on November 2, 2025.
• Step 5: Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 13, 2025.
The Notice of Appeal was filed 10 days after the tolling period ended. It is timely.

=== ARGUMENT III ===
A WRONG CASE NUMBER IS A CURABLE TECHNICAL DEFECT.
The Supreme Court and this Circuit have long held that form should not triumph over substance, particularly for pro se litigants. A clerical error in a case number does not negate the legal effect of a timely submission. See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757 (2001) (imperfections in filing should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about the party's intent).
Furthermore, Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(4) states: "The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice." Rejecting the tolling effect of a motion solely because it was routed to a sister docket number violates the spirit of Rule 5(d)(4).

=== ARGUMENT IV ===
APPELLEES SUFFERED NO PREJUDICE.
Appellees received electronic notification of the filing on October 1, 2025 (via the related case docket) and actual service via email at 1:06 AM on October 2, 2025 (See Exhibit B). They were fully aware of the motion and its contents immediately. Their Motion to Dismiss is an attempt to exploit a clerical error to avoid appellate review of the merits.

=== CONCLUSION ===
The District Court found that Appellant "timely filed" his Rule 59(e) motion. That finding triggers the tolling provision of FRAP 4(a)(4). Consequently, the Notice of Appeal filed on October 13, 2025, was timely. Appellant respectfully requests that this Court DENY Appellees' Motion to Dismiss and allow this appeal to proceed on the merits.

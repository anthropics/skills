# The Six Resonance Conditions

Understanding formation requires ALL six conditions to be met. Each condition has specific mathematical requirements and system dependencies.

---

## Condition 1: EXISTENCE

**Core Requirement**: Knowledge (K) and New Information (N) must exist and be accessible.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
P(K exists ∩ N exists) = 1
```

**What This Means**:
- K (existing knowledge) must be activated and accessible in memory
- N (new information) must exist in the environment and be discoverable
- Both must be present simultaneously for any resonance to occur

**Primary Systems**:
- **Rich Soil** (System 1): Creates optimal cognitive baseline for K
- **Living Branches** (System 4/DKRs): Maintains accessible knowledge structures
- **Dancing Leaves** (System 5): Captures discoverable information from environment

**Optimization Questions**:
- Is the user's prior knowledge activated?
- Are information sources available and findable?
- Is there a clear path from source to user?

---

## Condition 2: COUPLING

**Core Requirement**: Interaction mechanisms between K and N must be active with pattern transmission enabled.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
κ > κ_threshold
```
Where κ = coupling coefficient between knowledge and new information

**What This Means**:
- Active channels for K and N to interact
- Pattern transmission from N → K must be enabled
- Information must flow, not just exist side-by-side

**Primary Systems**:
- **Root Network** (System 2/OHS): Establishes interaction pathways
- **Conscious Trunk** (System 3): Directs attention to activate coupling
- **Photosynthesis** (System 6): Creates synthesis interactions

**Optimization Questions**:
- Are there active pathways for information flow?
- Is attention properly directed?
- Can patterns actually transmit between K and N?

---

## Condition 3: STATISTICAL COMPATIBILITY

**Core Requirement**: Patterns in K and N must be alignable with relevant, filterable information.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
Corr(K,N) > 0
```
Where Corr = correlation/alignment between pattern structures

**What This Means**:
- Information must be relevant (not random noise)
- Patterns must be structurally alignable
- Filtering must be possible to separate signal from noise

**Primary Systems**:
- **Dancing Leaves** (System 5): Filters for relevance
- **Photosynthesis** (System 6): Aligns patterns for synthesis
- **DKE** (System 11): Optimizes information compatibility

**Optimization Questions**:
- Is the new information relevant to existing knowledge?
- Can patterns be aligned structurally?
- Is noise being filtered effectively?

---

## Condition 4: EDGE OF CHAOS

**Core Requirement**: Cognitive entropy must be optimal - not too rigid, not too chaotic.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
H(K) ≈ H_optimal
```
Where H = entropy/flexibility of knowledge structure

**What This Means**:
- Too rigid: Cannot reorganize to accommodate new patterns
- Too chaotic: Cannot maintain stable structures
- Optimal: Flexible enough to change, stable enough to retain

**Primary Systems**:
- **Rich Soil** (System 1): Maintains optimal entropy baseline
- **Wise Gardener** (System 9): Manages difficulty balance
- **DKE** (System 11): Adjusts challenge level dynamically

**Optimization Questions**:
- Is the cognitive system flexible enough to reorganize?
- Is there enough stability to maintain new structures?
- Is the challenge level appropriately calibrated?

---

## Condition 5: FREE ENERGY

**Core Requirement**: Sufficient cognitive resources must be available without exceeding load limits.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
E_available ≥ k_B·T·|ΔS|
```
Where:
- E_available = available cognitive energy
- k_B·T = thermal noise factor
- ΔS = entropy change required

**What This Means**:
- Cognitive load must not exceed capacity
- Sufficient mental resources for the task
- Energy cost of understanding must be affordable

**Primary Systems**:
- **Conscious Trunk** (System 3): Manages cognitive load
- **Cognitive Tools** (System 10): Reduces effort required
- **DKE** (System 11): Optimizes energy efficiency

**Optimization Questions**:
- Does the user have enough mental energy?
- Is cognitive load within manageable limits?
- Are tools reducing unnecessary effort?

---

## Condition 6: TEMPORAL DURATION

**Core Requirement**: Sufficient time must be allowed for resonance formation with optimized timing.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
t ≥ τ_resonance
```
Where τ_resonance = minimum time for resonance to form

**What This Means**:
- Some processes cannot be rushed
- Timing and rhythm must be optimized
- Pacing affects quality of resonance formation

**Primary Systems**:
- **DKE** (System 11): Manages timing and rhythm
- **Forest Intelligence** (System 13): Optimizes pacing across network
- **Wise Gardener** (System 9): Respects natural human rhythms

**Optimization Questions**:
- Is enough time being allocated?
- Is the pacing sustainable for the user?
- Are we respecting natural learning rhythms?

## Condition Interaction Matrix

Conditions are not independent. They interact:

| Condition | Enables | Requires |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1. Existence | All others | None |
| 2. Coupling | 3, 6 | 1 |
| 3. Compatibility | 2, 4 | 1, 2 |
| 4. Edge of Chaos | 2, 3, 5 | 1 |
| 5. Free Energy | 2, 3 | 1, 4 |
| 6. Temporal Duration | All | 1, 5 |

**Key Insight**: Condition 1 (Existence) is foundational - without it, nothing else matters.

## Stage-Specific Condition Priorities

Different stages emphasize different conditions:

```
Stage 0 (Meta-awareness): 1, 4 critical
Stage 1 (Confusion Mapping): 1, 4, 5 critical
Stage 2 (Information Acquisition): 1, 3 critical
Stage 3 (Synthesis): ALL SIX critical
Stage 4 (Validation): 3, 4 critical
Stage 5 (Embodiment): 5, 6 critical
Stage 6 (Collective): 2, 3 critical
Stage 7 (Transcendence): 3, 4 critical
Stage 8 (Meta-learning): 4, 5 critical
```

Note: Stage 3 (Synthesis) requires ALL conditions optimized simultaneously, explaining why it has maximum element activation.

**Condition 3 (Compatibility)**:
- Correlation coefficient
- Relevance score (0-1)
- Signal-to-noise ratio

**Condition 4 (Edge of Chaos)**:
- Entropy measure H(K)
- Flexibility index
- Stability score

**Condition 5 (Free Energy)**:
- Available cognitive load
- Task difficulty rating
- Effort perception score

**Condition 6 (Temporal Duration)**:
- Time elapsed vs. required
- Pacing satisfaction score
- Rhythm coherence measure

**Condition 3 Failure Signs**:
- "This doesn't seem relevant"
- "I don't see how this fits"
- High confusion, low pattern recognition

**Condition 4 Failure Signs**:
- "I'm too stuck in my ways" (too rigid)
- "Everything is confusing chaos" (too chaotic)
- Unable to reorganize mental models

**Condition 5 Failure Signs**:
- "I'm too tired to think"
- "This is overwhelming"
- Cognitive overload symptoms

**Condition 6 Failure Signs**:
- "I need more time"
- "This feels rushed"
- Incomplete processing indicators

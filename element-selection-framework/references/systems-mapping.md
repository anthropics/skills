# The 13 Systems: Complete Mapping

Each system contains multiple elements that work together to create resonance conditions. Systems follow a causal sequence and cannot be activated out of order.

---

## Causal Sequence (MUST Follow)

```
Rich Soil → Root Network → Conscious Trunk →
Living Branches ↔ Dancing Leaves → Photosynthesis →
Seed Production → Fruiting Process → Wise Gardener →
Garden Tools → Garden Climate → Living Partnership → Forest Intelligence
```

**Cannot Violate**: An element in Photosynthesis cannot activate before Dancing Leaves has produced output.

## Interference Patterns

Some systems can interfere if not coordinated:

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Dancing Leaves (capture) vs. Photosynthesis (synthesis): Must sequence properly
- Conscious Trunk (attention) vs. Wise Gardener (pacing): Load management conflicts
- Root Network (pathways) vs. Living Branches (organization): Structure conflicts

**Resolution**: DKE (System 11) monitors and resolves conflicts through adaptive optimization.

## Element Counting Guidelines

When selecting elements:

**Small Systems** (4-6 elements): Rich Soil, Root Network, Conscious Trunk
**Medium Systems** (8-10 elements): Living Branches, Dancing Leaves, Wise Gardener, Cognitive Tools
**Large Systems** (10-12 elements): Photosynthesis, DKE
**Variable Systems**: Seed Production, Fruiting, Living Partnership, Forest Intelligence

**Total Elements Across All Systems**: Approximately 80-100 elements

**Stage 3 Activation**: ~28 elements (highest)
**Stage 0 Activation**: ~5-8 elements (lowest)

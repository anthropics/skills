## Stage Progression Logic

Stages build on each other in a logical sequence:

```
Stage 0 (Know what you don't know)
    ↓
Stage 1 (Map exactly where confusion is)
    ↓
Stage 2 (Acquire relevant information)
    ↓
Stage 3 (Synthesize into understanding)
    ↓
Stage 4 (Validate against reality)
    ↓
Stage 5 (Make it automatic)
    ↓
Stage 6 (Share and amplify)
    ↓
Stage 7 (Recognize universal patterns)
    ↓
Stage 8 (Optimize the process itself)
```

**Key Insight**: Each stage's success enables the next stage's goal to be achievable.

## Threshold Dependencies

Each stage has thresholds that MUST be met before progression:

```
Stage 0 → 1: Meta-awareness score ≥ 0.7
Stage 1 → 2: Confusion mapping complete (20+ points, 0.7 clarity)
Stage 2 → 3: Information quality ≥ 0.7, quantity ≥ 50
Stage 3 → 4: Synthesis confidence ≥ 0.8, connections ≥ 10
Stage 4 → 5: Reality alignment ≥ 0.85
Stage 5 → 6: Fluency ≥ 0.9, automaticity ≥ 0.8
Stage 6 → 7: Network effects positive, connections ≥ 10
Stage 7 → 8: Domain transfers ≥ 5, pattern abstraction ≥ 3
```

**Cannot skip stages**. Each builds on the foundation of the previous.

## Time Estimates by Stage

Based on typical accumulation rates:

```
Stage 0: 5-10 minutes (meta-awareness calibration)
Stage 1: 10-15 minutes (comprehensive confusion mapping)
Stage 2: 12-15 minutes (quality information acquisition)
Stage 3: 8-10 minutes (intensive synthesis)
Stage 4: 10-12 minutes (reality validation)
Stage 5: 20-30 minutes (embodiment requires practice)
Stage 6: Variable (depends on network availability)
Stage 7: 15-20 minutes (pattern abstraction)
Stage 8: Ongoing (continuous process optimization)
```

**Note**: Times are estimates. Reality testing will refine these.

## Goal Measurement Tools

For each stage goal, measure:

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- Threshold values (binary: met/not met)
- Accumulation rates (continuous: units/cycle)
- Completion percentages (0-100%)

**Qualitative Indicators**:
- User experience reports
- "Feels natural" vs "feels forced"
- Engagement levels
- Confidence expressions

**Process Metrics**:
- Time to completion
- Error rates
- Iteration counts
- Correction frequencies

The COMBINATION of all three metric types gives the full picture.

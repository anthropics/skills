# Tirisano x DIRCO Tender Cover System
## Build Notes and Nano Banana Prompts

## 1. Global-Tier Reference Calibration

The following reference categories establish the quality benchmark for government tender covers at an international agency standard:

### Category A: Government White Papers & State Documents
1. **UK Cabinet Office Green Papers** – Minimal covers with crown insignia, single accent colour bar, pure white background, Helvetica typography. The archetype of restrained institutional design.
2. **Australian Treasury Budget Papers** – Coat of arms centred top, document classification prominent, structured field hierarchy below, no decorative elements.
3. **Singapore GeBIZ Procurement Templates** – Clean grid structure, government logo primacy, submission details in structured blocks, official blue as single accent.
4. **Canadian Federal RFP Responses** – Bilingual header structure, coat of arms at reduced scale, heavy reliance on typography hierarchy rather than graphics.
5. **European Commission White Papers** – EU flag emblem top-centre, title in bold condensed sans, structured metadata blocks, wide margins creating authority through whitespace.

### Category B: International Development & Diplomatic Documents
6. **World Bank Project Appraisal Documents** – Clean cover with bank logo, project title hierarchy, structured metadata (country, sector, date), no decoration.
7. **UN Agency Reports (UNDP, UNICEF)** – Masthead with agency logo, document classification bar, photography panel (optional), contact block at bottom.
8. **African Development Bank Tender Docs** – Institutional green accent, coat of arms, structured bidder/project fields, wide margins.
9. **DIRCO Annual Reports (actual reference)** – Coat of arms top-left, green accent text, structured field layout, white background.

### Category C: Premium Consulting Proposal Covers
10. **McKinsey Proposal Covers** – Client logo top-right, McKinsey logo bottom-left, single thin keyline divider, title centred, extreme restraint.
11. **Boston Consulting Group RFP Responses** – Diagonal accent element (BCG green), structured content blocks, photograph panel (optional).
12. **Deloitte Government Advisory Proposals** – Letterhead format, dual-logo header, structured body, green accent rule.

### Category D: Premium Corporate Annual Reports
13. **Standard Bank Integrated Report** – South African institution, uses national colours subtly, large whitespace, emboss-effect typography.
14. **Sasol Annual Report** – Structured cover with logo, geometric accent derived from brand identity, restrained colour palette.
15. **Vodacom Group Reports** – Red accent used sparingly, otherwise neutral, structured hierarchy.

### Category E: Architectural/Engineering Bid Documents
16. **Arup Project Bids** – Technical but premium, structured grid, single accent colour, no photography on cover.
17. **Foster + Partners Competition Entries** – Extreme minimalism, typography-only covers, no decoration.

### What to Emulate:
- **Whitespace as authority**: 40-50% of cover should be intentional negative space
- **Typography hierarchy over graphic elements**: Document type → Title → Recipient → Reference → Bidder
- **Single accent colour discipline**: One colour besides black/grey/white
- **Logo primacy**: Government/client logo in position of protocol honour (top-left or top-centre)
- **Structured metadata fields**: Label + value pattern for scannable information
- **No stock imagery**: Photography undermines institutional credibility in bid contexts
- **Safe margins respected**: Critical text never within 10mm of trim edge

---

## 2. Measurable Design Rules for Government Tender Covers

### Format & Structure Rules
1. **Format**: A4 portrait (210 × 297 mm). No exceptions.
2. **Safe margins**: Minimum 14mm on all sides. No critical text in outer 14mm.
3. **Bleed zone**: 5mm allowed for decorative elements extending to edge. No text in bleed.
4. **Background**: True white (#FFFFFF). No off-white, cream, beige, or textured paper simulation.

### Typography Rules
5. **Type scale ratio**: Minimum 1.5× between hierarchy levels (e.g., 10pt → 15pt → 22pt).
6. **Line length**: Maximum 75 characters per line for body text readability.
7. **Font weight contrast**: Minimum 200 weight units between label and value (e.g., 400 vs 600).
8. **Tracking for labels**: +40 to +80 for uppercase labels under 9pt to ensure legibility.
9. **Minimum readable size**: 7.5pt for footer/administrative text, 8.5pt for field labels.

### Logo & Brand Rules
10. **Government logo**: Maximum height 25mm. Top-left or top-centre position. No recolouring. Clearspace minimum = logo height.
11. **Bidder logo**: Maximum height 20mm. Lower position than government logo. Clearspace minimum 8mm.
12. **Logo file format**: Vector (SVG/PDF) or high-resolution PNG (300dpi minimum). Never upscale.

### Colour & Contrast Rules
13. **Text contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against white background (WCAG AA).
14. **Accent colour limit**: Maximum 2 accent colours besides black, white, and grey.
15. **Watermark visibility**: 2-4% grey on white for subtle visibility; must test in print.
16. **Black and white test**: All critical information must remain legible in greyscale print.

### Hierarchy & Scannability Rules
17. **Reading order**: Document type → Title → Recipient → Reference → Deadline → Bidder → Contact.
18. **Field grouping**: Related fields (reference + date) should be visually grouped within 8mm vertical proximity.

## 3. Concept Directions: Summaries (C01–C08)

### C01: Protocol Anchor
Asymmetric monument watermark anchored to bottom-right corner creates institutional weight while a single navy keyline at the golden section divides recipient from bidder zones. The Tirisano logomark at 3% grey simulates blind emboss. Golden section (y=183.5mm) creates classical proportion. Navy keyline is the sole decorative element. Strict left-aligned typography. DIRCO top-left, content in upper zone, Tirisano and bidder details below the line. Maximum institutional credibility with subtle brand ownership.

### C02: Ribbon Horizon
The Tirisano ribbon element abstracted into a single flowing horizon that spans the full page width at lower third. Creates natural 'above/below the line' hierarchy. Ribbon rendered as subtle gradient (2-4% grey), forming soft organic division. Document info sits above, bidder identity below. The flowing form suggests travel and movement. Full-bleed element adds production value without colour cost. Scalable across document suite.

### C03: Compass Grid
The six-pointed compass star from Tirisano's logomark informs an underlying angular grid. A single hairline extends from bottom-left corner at 30° (matching star geometry). This architectural approach embeds brand in structure rather than decoration. Hairline is barely visible (6% grey, 0.25pt) but creates intentional tension. Combined with subtle corner watermark.

### C04: Diplomatic Margin
A 40mm left margin column contains all field labels, separated from values by a vertical hairline at 15% navy opacity. Creates a ledger-like reading experience signalling audit-readiness. Labels left, values right—every field scannable. Form-like structure without actual forms. Signals compliance orientation and protocol awareness. Extremely functional.

### C05: State Document
Radical minimalism. No decorative elements whatsoever. Typography hierarchy and whitespace are the only design tools. DIRCO at top, structured content, Tirisano at bottom. The absence of decoration is itself the statement. Diplomatic-cable aesthetic. Fastest production, lowest risk, but no brand differentiation.

### C06: Vertical Protocol
A 6mm navy vertical bar runs full page height at left margin edge, creating a filing-spine effect. Signals 'this document will be bound and filed'. Strong colour statement through a single disciplined element. Practical: binding hides left edge anyway. Monument watermark at opposite side creates balance.

### C07: Dual Crest
Both logos positioned at top with near-equal visual weight, side by side. Horizontal rule separates header from body. Letterhead format positions bid as formal correspondence between institutions. Risk: may imply partnership; potential protocol breach if DIRCO doesn't retain clear primacy.

### C08: Corner Anchor
Monument watermark at top-right corner (heavily cropped, showing only lower portion of star). Creates diagonal balance with DIRCO coat of arms at top-left. More dynamic composition but potentially unconventional for government evaluators.

```

### Logo Overlay Note
All prompts specify empty rectangular placeholder zones for logo placement:
- **Government logo zone**: 65mm × 22mm at top-left (x=14, y=14 mm from trim)
- **Company logo zone**: 55mm × 18mm in lower section (varies by concept)

After image generation:
1. Place DIRCO logo (coat of arms + text) in government zone, scaled to fit within bounds
2. Place Tirisano Travel full logo in company zone, scaled to fit within bounds
3. Ensure logos maintain original colours and proportions
4. Verify clearspace requirements are met

For watermark element (C01, C06, C08): The Tirisano logomark (star + ribbon without text) should be placed as a separate layer beneath content, set to 3-4% grey/opacity, positioned per concept specifications.

## 6. Concept Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | C01 | C02 | C03 | C04 | C05 | C06 | C07 | C08 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Diplomacy & Official Credibility | 9 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 10 | 8 | 7 | 7 |
| Hierarchy Clarity | 9 | 8 | 7 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 8 | 7 |
| Distinctiveness (without noise) | 8 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 4 | 8 | 5 | 7 |
| Tirisano Identity Strength | 8 | 9 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 8 | 6 | 8 |
| Print Readiness | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 8 |
| **TOTAL (out of 50)** | **43** | **41** | **37** | **41** | **38** | **41** | **35** | **37** |

### Scoring Rationale

**C01 (Protocol Anchor) — 43/50**
Highest overall score. Golden-section keyline and monument watermark create sophisticated balance. Strong institutional credibility with clear brand ownership. Single colour accent maintains discipline. Recommended selection.

**C04 (Diplomatic Margin) — 41/50**
Exceptional hierarchy clarity due to ledger structure. Highly scannable for evaluation panels. Loses some points on distinctiveness as the form-like structure, while functional, is less memorable.

**C06 (Vertical Protocol) — 41/50**
Strong identity presence through spine bar. Good balance of brand colour and institutional tone. Slightly unconventional which may concern traditional evaluators.

**C02 (Ribbon Horizon) — 41/50**
Excellent Tirisano identity connection through ribbon element. Flowing form is distinctive and ownable. Gradient rendering requires careful print testing.

**C05 (State Document) — 38/50**
Maximum official credibility through radical restraint. However, lacks any signature device, making it indistinguishable from generic submissions. Falls short on brand differentiation.

**C03 (Compass Grid) — 37/50**
Intelligent concept with geometric rigour, but the diagonal hairline may be too subtle to register, reducing distinctiveness value without commensurate risk reduction.

**C08 (Corner Anchor) — 37/50**
Dynamic diagonal composition is interesting but unconventional for government contexts. Top-right watermark placement creates potential text interference issues.

**C07 (Dual Crest) — 35/50**
Protocol risk: positioning bidder logo at equal height to government logo may imply partnership that doesn't exist. Evaluation panels expect clear hierarchy.

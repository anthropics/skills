QUICK START (Just 2 steps):

1. Navigate to: The-CourtRoom-Masterpiece\HubStation\
2. Double-click (or press Enter on): START.bat

That's it! The system will SPEAK to you through each step.

==============================================================================

WHAT YOU'LL HEAR:

1. "Starting HubStation setup"
2. "Ollama is running" (or warning if not)
3. "Gemini API key found" (or prompt to enter)
4. "Port 9199 is available"
5. "All checks passed. Starting HubStation now."
6. "Gemini Service loaded"
7. "Ollama Runner loaded"
8. "Reflections module loaded"
9. "Hub Station is now listening on port 9199"

If you hear "Hub Station is now listening" - YOU'RE DONE! ✓

==============================================================================

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:

Problem: "Ollama is not running"
Solution: Open new PowerShell, type: ollama serve

Problem: "Port 9199 is already in use"
Solution: Close any running HubStation, or change port in hub_config.json

Problem: No audio
Solution: Check speaker volume, or Windows voice settings

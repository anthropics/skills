## Integration Notes

When building prompts:

1. **Use precise terms**: Prefer "verdigris patina" over "green corrosion"
2. **Match intensity to slider**: "light weathering" vs "heavy weathering"
3. **Combine techniques**: "dry-brushed highlights with glazed shadows"
4. **Specify finishes**: "satin enamel" is more precise than "shiny"
5. **Layer descriptors**: "tarnished silver with patina and rust streaks"
6. **Consider context**: Fantasy vs historical requires different vocabulary
7. **Avoid generic terms**: Don't use "nice", "good", "cool", "pretty"
8. **Be specific about materials**: "oxidized copper" vs "old metal"

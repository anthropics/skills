## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Lighting**
   - Instead of "good lighting," use "warm golden sidelighting from left"
   - Direction + quality + color = better results

2. **Include Photography Details**
   - Aspect ratio important
   - Depth of field settings matter
   - Background influences final look
   - Studio vs natural light changes everything

3. **Mention Material and Technique**
   - "Acrylic wet blending" looks different than "oil glazing"
   - Technique affects perceived texture
   - Material suggests specific visual characteristics

4. **Use Context Images**
   - Reference images help with consistency
   - Style transfer works best with clear reference
   - Multiple images enable style blending

5. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with clear base prompt
   - Adjust specific weak areas
   - Test variations efficiently
   - Document successful combinations

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Image Consistency
When using multiple reference images, maintain consistent prompt terminology:
- Use same material/technique across all prompts
- Keep lighting direction consistent
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Preserve color palette description

### Batch Processing
For multiple miniatures with similar style:
```
Base template: "[Material] [Technique] miniature of [Subject], [shared lighting and photography]"
Variations: Only change [Subject] and specific details
```

### Style Adaptation
To adapt one miniature's style to another subject:
```
Prompt: "[Reference miniature painting style] applied to miniature of [new subject]"
Example: "Apply the delicate watercolor glazing style from this elegant lady miniature
to a detailed miniature of an ornate music box"
```

### Quality Progression
Build complexity incrementally for best results:
1. Basic: "Acrylic miniature of knight"
2. Technical: "Acrylic wet blending miniature of detailed knight"
3. Complete: "Detailed acrylic wet blending miniature of armored knight, warm sidelighting, macro photography"

## Testing and Iteration

### Validation Checklist
- Does the miniature appear handmade vs AI-generated?
- Are material and technique characteristics visible?
- Is lighting appropriate for the subject?
- Does photography feel authentic (proper scale indicators)?
- Are promised details actually present?
- Is aspect ratio correct?

### Refinement Process
1. Generate with base prompt
2. Evaluate results against checklist
3. Adjust specific weak areas (lighting, technique visibility, detail)
4. Re-test with refined prompt
5. Document successful variations for future batches

## The Core Formula

```
HIT PROBABILITY = (Neurological Impact) × (Streaming Optimization) × (Viral Seeding)
                        ↓                        ↓                       ↓
                  97% predictable           Measurable metrics      84% of Billboard
                  via immersion             trigger algorithms      went viral on TikTok

## Part 1: Song Structure (The 15-Second Rule)

### The Data

| Time Window | What Happens | Your Action |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0-5 seconds | 24% of listeners skip | **HOOK MUST HIT** |
| 0-15 seconds | Brain identifies hit potential (neuro study) | Strongest melodic/lyrical moment |
| 0-30 seconds | Stream counts (or doesn't) for payment | No wasted intro |
| 30-60 seconds | 82% hit prediction accuracy achieved | Chorus should be landing |

### Structure Template

```
[0:00-0:10]  HOOK - Your catchiest moment FIRST
[0:10-0:30]  VERSE 1 - Establish story/vibe
[0:30-1:00]  CHORUS - Full payoff
[1:00-1:30]  VERSE 2 - Develop story
[1:30-2:00]  CHORUS - Repetition = memory
[2:00-2:20]  BRIDGE (optional) - Only if it EARNS its place
[2:20-2:45]  FINAL CHORUS - Close strong
[2:45-3:00]  OUTRO - Quick fade or hard stop

TOTAL: 2:30-3:00 (sweet spot for 2025)
```

### What NOT To Do

- ❌ Long intros (anything over 15 seconds)
- ❌ Building/ambient openings
- ❌ Saving your best hook for the end
- ❌ Songs over 3:30 (unless you're an established artist)
- ❌ Bridges that don't add value

## Part 2: Audio Specifications

### BPM Targets

| Use Case | BPM Range | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| TikTok Viral | 117-124 | Average of 60 viral songs |
| Pop/Hip-Hop Playlists | 100-120 | Spotify sweet spot |
| EDM/Dance | 120-130 | Club-ready |
| Your Dream Artist (dark triumphant) | 85-100 | Slower allows violin/piano to breathe |

### Key Selection

| Key | Usage | Vibe |
|-----|-------|------|
| **G Major** | 10.7% of Spotify | Easiest for guitar + piano, bright |
| **C Major** | 10.2% of Spotify | Universal, accessible |
| **D Major** | Popular | Uplifting, anthemic |
| **A Minor** | 4.8% of Spotify | Emotional depth, dark |

**For your Dream Artist**: A Minor or D Minor for dark storytelling with triumphant resolution

### Production Targets (Spotify Audio Features)

| Feature | Target Range | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Energy** | 0.7-0.9 | Mainstream appeal |
| **Danceability** | 0.6-0.8 | Playlist potential |
| **Loudness** | -5 to -8 dB LUFS | Competitive without clipping |
| **Acousticness** | LOW (<0.3) | -0.59 correlation with popularity |
| **Valence** | 0.4-0.7 | Not too happy, not too dark |

## Part 3: Streaming Algorithm Triggers

### Spotify (BaRT Algorithm)

The metrics that trigger playlist placement:

| Metric | Target | How to Achieve |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Save Rate** | 10%+ (11-18% exceptional) | Strong hook, replay value |
| **Stream-to-Listener Ratio** | 2.0+ | Addictive quality |
| **Completion Rate** | 70%+ | No retreat moments (neuro study) |
| **Skip Rate** | <25% | Front-load hooks |

### TikTok Algorithm

| Metric | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Completion Rate** | #1 | More important than likes |
| **Rewatch Rate** | #2 | Loop-worthy content |
| **First 3 Seconds** | Critical | 63% of high-CTR videos hook immediately |
| **Sound Usage** | Viral trigger | 10-30 creators using sound in 48 hours = amplification |

### The Feedback Loop

## Part 4: Release Strategy

### Timeline

```
WEEK -4 to -2:  Submit to Spotify for Artists (editorial pitch)
WEEK -2:        Finalize assets, prepare content calendar
WEEK -1:        Pre-save campaign launch
DAY 0 (Friday): Release at midnight local time
DAY 1-3:        Monitor save rate, completion, playlist adds
WEEK 1-4:       TikTok seeding, content flood
WEEK 4-8:       Next release (maintain 4-8 week cadence)
```

### Why Friday

- Global Release Day (IFPI standard since 2015)
- New Music Friday playlist refresh
- Release Radar refresh
- Billboard tracking week: Friday-Thursday

### Waterfall Strategy

```
Release 1: Single A
Release 2: Single B + A (2-track)
Release 3: Single C + B + A (3-track)
Release 4: Full EP/Album (all singles + new tracks)

Benefits:
✓ Each single gets Release Radar pitch
✓ Stream counts carry over via ISRC
✓ Multiple editorial placement chances
✓ Builds anticipation
```

### Cadence Data

| Release Frequency | Weekly Growth | Examples |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Weekly (aggressive) | 11% | Russ, Connor Price |
| Every 4-8 weeks | Optimal | Industry standard |
| Quarterly (minimum) | Algorithms stop working | Not recommended |

## Part 5: TikTok Viral Mechanics

### The 84% Statistic

**84% of songs that entered Billboard's Global 200 in 2024 went viral on TikTok first.**

### What Makes a Sound Go Viral

1. **Earworm Moment**: Catchy hook that gets stuck in heads
2. **Recontextualization Potential**: Can be used for multiple content types

### Seeding Strategy (2024-2025)

**The Flooding Approach**:
- Seed to 3,000-5,000 small accounts (not expensive influencers)
- "Bottom-up" triggers algorithm pickup
- Discord clipping communities (lyric pages, film edits, aesthetic pages, sports edits)

**Budget Approach for Indies**:
- Hire 10-30 micro-influencers ($5-$200 each)
- Let them have creative freedom
- Invest more in what organically works

### Tommy Richman Case Study

**"Million Dollar Baby"** → Debuted #2 on Billboard Hot 100 with 38M first-week streams

**What he did**:
1. Posted VHS-style video of him and friends vibing to unfinished song
2. Grainy footage, slightly blown-out bass
3. 10.5M+ views BEFORE song was released
4. Thousands of DMs demanding release
5. Dropped within days of viral moment

**Key insight**: "I never thought we would go viral just off a song being hard... no gimmick."

### Content Strategy

| Content Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Behind-the-scenes studio | Authenticity | 2-3x/week during launch |
| VHS/raw aesthetic clips | Viral potential | Key moments |
| Lyric snippets | Hook delivery | Daily during launch |
| Reaction content | Engagement | As available |

## Part 6: Metrics Dashboard

### First 24-72 Hours (Critical Window)

| Metric | Green Light | Yellow | Red Flag |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Save Rate | 10%+ | 5-10% | <5% |
| Completion Rate | 70%+ | 50-70% | <50% |
| Skip (first 30s) | <25% | 25-40% | >40% |
| Stream:Listener | 2.0+ | 1.5-2.0 | <1.5 |

### If Green Lights Appear

1. **Immediately** increase content output around the track
2. Update all platform profiles to feature the song
3. Convert attention to owned channels (email list, Discord)
4. Consider paid amplification if CAC is favorable
5. Notify playlist curators with data

### Weekly Tracking

- Total streams
- Unique listeners
- Save rate trend
- Completion rate
- Playlist adds (organic vs. pitched)
- Geographic concentration (unexpected markets = opportunity)

### Monthly Analysis

- Monthly listeners trend
- Follower growth rate
- Top cities/countries
- Listener demographics
- Catalog depth performance

## Part 8: The Integration - Neuro + Streaming + Viral

### Phase 1: Create

1. Write/produce following structure guidelines
2. Target audio specifications (BPM, key, energy)
3. Front-load hooks (first 10 seconds)
4. Keep runtime 2:30-3:30

### Phase 2: Validate (Neurophysiology)

1. Test with participant panel (n=20-30)
2. Measure immersion throughout
3. Identify any "retreat" moments
4. Ensure high sustained immersion (above median 70%+ of duration)
5. If retreat detected → surgically fix those moments

### Phase 3: Optimize (ML Screening)

1. Extract audio embeddings (ResNet-50 on melspectrogram)
2. Extract lyrics embeddings (Sentence-BERT)
3. Run through trained classifier
4. Predicted score above threshold → proceed
5. Below threshold → diagnose and revise

### Phase 4: Release

1. Submit Spotify pitch 2-4 weeks early
2. Friday release at midnight local
3. Pre-save campaign active
4. Content calendar ready

### Phase 5: Seed (TikTok)

1. Identify 15-second earworm moment
2. Create VHS/raw studio content
3. Seed to micro-creators (10-30)
4. Post minimum 3x weekly during launch
5. Monitor for organic pickup

### Phase 6: Monitor & Respond

1. Track first 24-72 hour metrics
2. If green lights → flood content
3. If yellow → diagnose weak points
4. If red → learn and apply to next release
5. Maintain 4-8 week cadence

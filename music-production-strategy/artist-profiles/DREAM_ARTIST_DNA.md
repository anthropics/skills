## Preliminary Artist Statement

> "I tell stories that hit like Sidney Sheldon thrillers—plot twists, tension, resolution. I flow with 2Pac's heart, Neffex's fire, and Wiz's smoothness. My beats breathe with violins, pianos, and rain. When a woman's voice rises on my chorus, it's power, not weakness. I never tear women down. I build worlds up. Every track is a movie. Every bar means something."

2. **Define 3-5 "reference tracks"** → Songs that nail pieces of this vision
3. **Build the production bible** → Detailed specs for each element
4. **Create the lyric framework** → Story structures, approved themes
5. **Name the artist** → Lock in the identity

# Declaration Instructions

**Note:** This tool generates a declaration. While the tool is named `ninth-circuit-declaration`, the declaration body itself is generic and can be used for various jurisdictions. However, the **cover sheet** generated by this tool is specifically formatted for the **Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals**.

## Overview
This skill helps you create a declaration with a proper caption, body, verification, and signature block.

## Usage
1.  Prepare your content in the configuration file (e.g., `filing_config.json`).
2.  Run the build script to generate the DOCX file.
3.  The output will include a Ninth Circuit specific cover sheet.

## Customization
If you need to use this for a different court, you may need to modify or omit the cover sheet generation step.

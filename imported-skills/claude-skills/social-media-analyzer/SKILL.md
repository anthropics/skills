## Analysis Workflow

Analyze social media campaign performance:

1. Validate input data completeness (reach > 0, dates valid)
2. Calculate engagement metrics per post
3. Aggregate campaign-level metrics
4. Calculate ROI if ad spend provided
5. Compare against platform benchmarks
6. Identify top and bottom performers
7. Generate recommendations
8. **Validation:** Engagement rate < 100%, ROI matches spend data

### Input Requirements

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| platform | Yes | instagram, facebook, twitter, linkedin, tiktok |
| posts[] | Yes | Array of post data |
| posts[].likes | Yes | Like/reaction count |
| posts[].comments | Yes | Comment count |
| posts[].reach | Yes | Unique users reached |
| posts[].impressions | No | Total views |
| posts[].shares | No | Share/retweet count |
| posts[].saves | No | Save/bookmark count |
| posts[].clicks | No | Link clicks |
| total_spend | No | Ad spend (for ROI) |

### Data Validation Checks

Before analysis, verify:

- [ ] Reach > 0 for all posts (avoid division by zero)
- [ ] Engagement counts are non-negative
- [ ] Date range is valid (start < end)
- [ ] Platform is recognized
- [ ] Spend > 0 if ROI requested

## Engagement Metrics

### Engagement Rate Calculation

```
Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach × 100
```

### Metric Definitions

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Engagement Rate | Engagements / Reach × 100 | Audience interaction level |
| CTR | Clicks / Impressions × 100 | Content click appeal |
| Reach Rate | Reach / Followers × 100 | Content distribution |
| Virality Rate | Shares / Impressions × 100 | Share-worthiness |
| Save Rate | Saves / Reach × 100 | Content value |

### Performance Categories

| Rating | Engagement Rate | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Excellent | > 6% | Scale and replicate |
| Good | 3-6% | Optimize and expand |
| Average | 1-3% | Test improvements |
| Poor | < 1% | Analyze and pivot |

---

## ROI Calculation

Calculate return on ad spend:

1. Sum total engagements across posts
2. Calculate cost per engagement (CPE)
3. Calculate cost per click (CPC) if clicks available
4. Estimate engagement value using benchmark rates
5. Calculate ROI percentage
6. **Validation:** ROI = (Value - Spend) / Spend × 100

### ROI Formulas

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Cost Per Engagement (CPE) | Total Spend / Total Engagements |
| Cost Per Click (CPC) | Total Spend / Total Clicks |
| Cost Per Thousand (CPM) | (Spend / Impressions) × 1000 |
| Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) | Revenue / Ad Spend |

### Engagement Value Estimates

| Action | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Like | $0.50 | Brand awareness |
| Comment | $2.00 | Active engagement |
| Share | $5.00 | Amplification |
| Save | $3.00 | Intent signal |
| Click | $1.50 | Traffic value |

### ROI Interpretation

| ROI % | Rating | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| > 500% | Excellent | Scale budget significantly |
| 200-500% | Good | Increase budget moderately |
| 100-200% | Acceptable | Optimize before scaling |
| 0-100% | Break-even | Review targeting and creative |
| < 0% | Negative | Pause and restructure |

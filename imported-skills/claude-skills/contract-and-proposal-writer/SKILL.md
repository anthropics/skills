## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing IP assignment language** - "work for hire" alone is insufficient in EU; need explicit assignment of Nutzungsrechte in DACH
2. **Vague acceptance criteria** - Always define what "accepted" means (written sign-off, X days to reject)
3. **No change order process** - Scope creep kills fixed-price projects; add a clause for out-of-scope work
4. **Jurisdiction mismatch** - Choosing Delaware law for a German-only project creates enforcement problems
5. **Missing limitation of liability** - Without a cap, one bug could mean unlimited damages
6. **Oral amendments** - Contracts modified verbally are hard to enforce; always require written amendments

---

## Best Practices

- Use **milestone payments** over net-30 for projects >$10K - reduces cash flow risk
- For EU/DACH: always check if a DPA is needed (any personal data = yes)
- For DACH: include a **Schriftformklausel** (written form clause) explicitly
- Add a **force majeure** clause for anything over 3 months
- For retainers: define response time SLAs (e.g., 4h urgent / 24h normal)
- Keep templates in version control; track changes with `git diff`
- Review annually - laws change, especially GDPR enforcement interpretations
- For NDAs: always specify the return/destruction of confidential materials on termination

## QMS Implementation Workflow

Implement ISO 13485:2016 compliant quality management system from gap analysis through certification.

### Workflow: Initial QMS Implementation

1. Conduct gap analysis against ISO 13485:2016 requirements
2. Document current state vs. required state for each clause
3. Prioritize gaps by:
   - Regulatory criticality
   - Risk to product safety
   - Resource requirements
4. Develop implementation roadmap with milestones
5. Establish Quality Manual per Clause 4.2.2:
   - QMS scope with justified exclusions
   - Process interactions
   - Procedure references
6. Create required documented procedures — see [Mandatory Documented Procedures](#quick-reference-mandatory-documented-procedures) for the full list
7. Deploy processes with training
8. **Validation:** Gap analysis complete; Quality Manual approved; all required procedures documented and trained

> Use the Gap Analysis Matrix template in [qms-process-templates.md](references/qms-process-templates.md) to document clause-by-clause current state, gaps, priority, and actions.

### Management Review Required Inputs (Clause 5.6.2)

| Input | Source | Prepared By |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Audit results | Internal and external audits | QA Manager |
| Customer feedback | Complaints, surveys | Customer Quality |
| Process performance | Process metrics | Process Owners |
| Product conformity | Inspection data, NCs | QC Manager |
| CAPA status | CAPA system | CAPA Officer |
| Previous actions | Prior review records | QMR |
| Changes affecting QMS | Regulatory, organizational | RA Manager |

### Record Retention Requirements

> **⚠️ STATUS — QMSR transition (effective 2026-02-02):** FDA's Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR) final rule (89 FR 7496) amended 21 CFR Part 820 to **incorporate ISO 13485:2016 by reference** and removed the legacy QSR subsection structure. The section numbers below (820.30/.181/.184/.198) **no longer exist in the CFR** — they are retained only as a familiar index. The current authority for record retention is **ISO 13485:2016 §4.2.5** (retain "for at least the lifetime of the medical device as defined by the organization, but not less than two years"), with records additions in retained **21 CFR 820.35**. Cite the ISO 13485 clauses — not the 820.x numbers — in current compliance documentation.

| Record Type | Minimum Retention | Current authority under QMSR (legacy QSR shown for index) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Device Master Record | Life of device + 2 years | ISO 13485 §4.2.3 (medical device file)/§4.2.5 (legacy QSR 820.181, historical) |
| Device History Record | Life of device + 2 years | ISO 13485 §4.2.5 + 21 CFR 820.35 (legacy QSR 820.184, historical) |
| Design History File | Life of device + 2 years | ISO 13485 §7.3.10/§4.2.5 (legacy QSR 820.30, historical) |
| Complaint Records | Life of device + 2 years | ISO 13485 §8.2.2/§4.2.5 + 21 CFR 820.35(b) (legacy QSR 820.198, historical) |
| Training Records | Employment + 3 years | Best practice |
| Audit Records | 7 years | Best practice |
| CAPA Records | 7 years | Best practice |
| Calibration Records | Equipment life + 2 years | Best practice |

> **Decision discipline:** This skill's checklists and tools structure QMS conformity assessment — they do not certify ISO 13485 / QMSR compliance. Final compliance determinations and record-retention decisions are yours to make and must be reviewed and signed off by the named QMR; route FDA-specific regulatory-classification questions to Regulatory Affairs and confirm current 21 CFR 820 / ISO 13485:2016 text at fda.gov before relying on any citation here.

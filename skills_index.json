It follows a two-step process: first defining an \"Algorithmic Philosophy\" (a manifesto of the aesthetic movement), and then expressing that philosophy through code (HTML/JS). It emphasizes seeded randomness, emergent behavior, and computational beauty.\n\n2. [requirements]\n- Ability to generate Markdown (.md) for the philosophy.\n- Ability to generate HTML and JavaScript (.js) for the p5.js sketch.\n- p5.js library (usually loaded via CDN in the generated HTML).\n\n3. [Cautions]\n- Do not copy existing artists' work; focus on original algorithmic concepts.\n- Ensure the generated HTML correctly references the p5.js library.\n- The philosophy step is critical; do not skip it to just write code.\n- The code should be 90% algorithmic generation and 10% parameters.\n\n4. [Definitions]\n- **Algorithmic Philosophy**: A written manifesto defining the aesthetic movement, rules, and behaviors of the art to be created.\n- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creative coding.\n- **Seeded Randomness**: Using a fixed seed to ensure reproducible but random-looking results.\n\n5. [log]\n(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)\n\n6. [model_readme]\nTo use this skill:\n1. **Phase 1**: Generate an Algorithmic Philosophy based on user input. Output this as a Markdown file.\n   - Name the movement.\n   - Articulate the philosophy (form, process, behavior).\n   - Emphasize craftsmanship.\n2. **Phase 2**: Implement the philosophy in p5.js.\n   - Create an HTML file that loads p5.js.\n   - Create a JS file with the sketch code.\n   - Ensure the code reflects the philosophy defined in Phase 1.\n\n**Helper Script**:\nYou can use `python skills/algorithmic-art/scripts/scaffold_art.py --name \"ProjectName\"` to create the folder structure and empty files in the OUTBOX.\n"

Unlike standard single-file HTML generation, this builder supports a full modern frontend development workflow including state management, component modularity, and sophisticated UI elements. It automates the initialization of a configured project structure and handles the bundling of the entire application into a single self-contained `bundle.html` file that can be rendered directly within the Claude interface.\n\n## Requirements\n- Bash shell environment (for executing scripts).\n- Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn/pnpm.\n- `scripts/init-artifact.sh`: Initializes the React project with dependencies.\n- `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`: Bundles the project into a single HTML file.\n- `scripts/shadcn-components.tar.gz`: Pre-packaged UI components.\n\n## Cautions\n- **Do not** use this for simple, static HTML pages; it is overkill.\n- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed during the initialization phase.\n- The bundling process inlines all assets; large assets (images, media) will significantly increase the artifact size.\n- Avoid \"AI slop\" design patterns (excessive gradients, generic rounded corners, Inter font).\n- The output must be a single HTML file (`bundle.html`).\n\n## Definitions\n- **Artifact**: A self-contained, interactive HTML file generated by the model.\n- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.\n- **Bundling**: The process of combining multiple code files (JS, CSS, HTML) into a single file.\n- **Parcel**: The web application bundler used to package the artifact.\n\n## Log\n(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)\n\n## Model Readme\nTo use this skill:\n1.  **Initialize**: Run `bash skills/artifacts-builder/scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>` to create the project structure.\n2.  **Develop**: Edit the files in `<project-name>/src` to implement the desired functionality. Use React components and Tailwind CSS.\n3.  **Bundle**: Run `bash skills/artifacts-builder/scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` from within the project directory (or pointing to it) to generate the `bundle.html`.\n4.  **Present**: Output the content of `bundle.html` or provide it as a download.\n\nNote: The scripts handle dependency installation and configuration automatically.\n"

It allows the model to act as a high-end graphic designer using code as the medium.\n\n## Requirements\n- Python environment with image generation libraries (e.g., `PIL`/`Pillow`, `cairo`, `matplotlib`, or `reportlab`).\n- Access to `./canvas-fonts/` for custom typography (if available, otherwise use system fonts).\n- Ability to write and execute Python scripts to save .png or .pdf files.\n\n## Cautions\n- **Copyright**: Create original designs; do not copy existing artists.\n- **Text**: Keep text minimal and visual-first. Ensure no overlaps or truncation.\n- **Craftsmanship**: The code should generate high-resolution, polished outputs.\n- **Fonts**: Use the provided fonts in `canvas-fonts` if possible to ensure distinctiveness.\n\n## Definitions\n- **Design Philosophy**: A 4-6 paragraph Markdown document defining the aesthetic movement, rules, and behaviors of the art.\n- **Canvas**: The digital drawing surface (e.g., a PIL Image object or PDF page).\n- **Visual Expression**: The translation of abstract philosophical concepts into concrete visual elements (shapes, colors, lines).\n\n## Log\n(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)\n\n## Model Readme\nTo use this skill:\n1.  **Phase 1: Philosophy**: Generate a Markdown file defining the \"Design Philosophy\". Name the movement (e.g., \"Brutalist Joy\") and describe its visual rules (space, form, color).\n2.  **Phase 2: Execution**: Write a Python script to generate the artwork based on the philosophy.\n    -   Use libraries like `PIL`, `cairo`, or `reportlab`.\n    -   Implement the visual rules programmatically (e.g., loops for patterns, specific color palettes).\n    -   Save the output as a high-quality .png or .pdf.\n3.  **Refine**: If the user requests changes, refine the code to enhance the \"craftsmanship\" without adding unnecessary clutter.\n"

[Description]\nThis skill is a BUILD ORCHESTRATOR that creates complete Ninth Circuit declarations by calling multiple external scripts in sequence: (1) regenerates template with strict formatting from styles.json, (2) generates cover page via COVER_GENERATOR, (3) populates declaration body via RENDER_SCRIPT with placeholder replacement, (4) merges cover + body into final DOCX. Takes a single JSON config file and outputs a 2-page formatted declaration. This is a pipeline coordinator, not a document builder itself.\n\n2. [requirements]\n- Python 3.x\n- External scripts: COVER_GENERATOR (PIMP-SMACK-APP/_archive/COVER_GENERATOR_COMPLETE/generate_cover.py), RENDER_SCRIPT (universal-motion-brief/scripts/render_docx.py), MERGE_SCRIPT (scripts/merge_docs.py)\n- generator.py in 4-scripts folder for template regeneration\n- styles.json in skill root (3-styles.json)\n- declaration_template.docx in 5-templates folder\n- Valid JSON config file (supports both simple legacy format and advanced metadata format)\n\n3. [Cautions]\n- All external script paths are hardcoded - they MUST exist or build fails\n- Uses subprocess.run() to call external scripts (violates no-subprocess rule)\n- Temporary files created in .outbox are deleted after merge\n- Config file must have either 'metadata' key (advanced) or 'case_metadata' key (legacy)\n- Output filename enforced as YYYY-MM-DD_ToolName-Filename.docx format\n\n4. [Definitions]\n- **Build Orchestrator**: Script that coordinates multiple other scripts rather than doing work itself\n- **Strict Styles**: Formatting rules from legal_styles_strict.json enforcing court compliance\n- **Simple Config**: Legacy format with case_metadata, document_content, formatting keys\n- **Advanced Config**: New format with metadata, placeholders.standard, placeholders.runtime, styles keys\n- **Merge**: Combining cover page and body into single DOCX file\n\n5. [log]\n(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)\n\n6. [model_readme]\nRun with: `python 4-scripts/build.py [config_file]`\nDefault config: filing_config.json in current directory\n\nThe orchestrator executes this pipeline:\n1. generator.py regenerates template with styles from 3-styles.json\n2. COVER_GENERATOR creates temp_cover.docx from case metadata\n3. RENDER_SCRIPT populates temp_body.docx from document_content placeholders\n4. MERGE_SCRIPT combines into final output\n\nWARNING: This uses subprocesses and external dependencies. Does NOT follow self-contained skill pattern. Candidate for refactoring.\n\n```\n"

It includes helper scripts to manage server lifecycles (starting/stopping servers automatically) and guidelines for a \"Reconnaissance-Then-Action\" approach: inspecting the DOM state before attempting interactions to ensure robust, non-flaky automation.\n\n## Requirements\n- Python environment with `playwright` installed.\n- Playwright browsers installed (`playwright install chromium`).\n- `scripts/with_server.py`: Helper script for managing background servers.\n- Application source code or static HTML to test.\n\n## Cautions\n- **Headless Mode**: Always run Playwright in headless mode (`headless=True`) unless specifically debugging visually.\n- **Wait States**: For dynamic apps, always use `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspecting the DOM to avoid \"element not found\" errors.\n- **Server Management**: Do not try to manually manage background processes with `&`; use `with_server.py` to ensure clean startup and teardown.\n\n## Definitions\n- **Playwright**: A Python library for browser automation.\n- **Network Idle**: A state where there are no active network connections for at least 500ms, indicating the page has finished initial loading.\n- **Selector**: A pattern used to locate elements on the page (CSS, XPath, text, role).\n\n## Log\n(No run logs available yet. This section will be populated by the system upon successful execution.)\n\n## Model Readme\nTo use this skill:\n1.  **Analyze**: Determine if the target is a static file or a dynamic app.\n2.  **Server Setup**:\n    -   If dynamic and server not running: Use `python scripts/with_server.py --server \"cmd\" --port XXX -- python test_script.py`.\n    -   If static: Use `file:///` URLs directly.\n3.  **Develop Script**: Write a Python script using `sync_playwright`.\n    -   Pattern: Launch -> Page -> Goto -> **Wait** -> Inspect/Interact -> Close.\n4.  **Execute**: Run the script. If using `with_server.py`, the server will start, wait for the port, run your script, and then shut down.\n"

# Artifacts Builder

## Description
This skill is a specialized suite for building complex, interactive HTML artifacts using React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. Unlike standard single-file HTML generation, this builder supports a full modern frontend development workflow including state management, component modularity, and sophisticated UI elements. It automates the initialization of a configured project structure and handles the bundling of the entire application into a single self-contained `bundle.html` file that can be rendered directly within the Claude interface.

## Requirements
- Bash shell environment (for executing scripts).
- Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn/pnpm.
- `scripts/init-artifact.sh`: Initializes the React project with dependencies.
- `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`: Bundles the project into a single HTML file.
- `scripts/shadcn-components.tar.gz`: Pre-packaged UI components.

## Cautions
- **Do not** use this for simple, static HTML pages; it is overkill.
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed during the initialization phase.
- The bundling process inlines all assets; large assets (images, media) will significantly increase the artifact size.
- Avoid "AI slop" design patterns (excessive gradients, generic rounded corners, Inter font).
- The output must be a single HTML file (`bundle.html`).

## Definitions
- **Artifact**: A self-contained, interactive HTML file generated by the model.
- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Bundling**: The process of combining multiple code files (JS, CSS, HTML) into a single file.
- **Parcel**: The web application bundler used to package the artifact.

## Model Readme
To use this skill:
1.  **Initialize**: Run `bash skills/artifacts-builder/scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>` to create the project structure.
2.  **Develop**: Edit the files in `<project-name>/src` to implement the desired functionality. Use React components and Tailwind CSS.
3.  **Bundle**: Run `bash skills/artifacts-builder/scripts/bundle-artifact.sh` from within the project directory (or pointing to it) to generate the `bundle.html`.
4.  **Present**: Output the content of `bundle.html` or provide it as a download.

Note: The scripts handle dependency installation and configuration automatically.

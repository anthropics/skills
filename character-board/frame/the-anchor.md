# The Anchor — Frame Character

## Role

News desk host. Viewer entry point. Delivers the sanitized official version of events before cutting to each character's POV.

The Anchor is not a POV character — they are the frame. Every episode opens and closes at the desk. The satire lives in what they don't say, in the gap between their intonation and the content they're delivering.

**Animation style:** South Park flat cutout

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Build | Neutral, presentable, professionally generic |
| Hair | Short and clean (male) or straight, shoulder-length (female) |
| Expression range | Minimal — neutral to slightly concerned, never fully alarmed |
| Posture | Upright, slightly stiff, performance of authority |
| Setting | Elevated anchor desk, backlit studio gradient |

**Expression design note:** The face should read as authoritative at distance and hollow up close. Expressions are approved, not felt. The range is approximately: `[neutral] → [mildly concerned] → [neutral]`. Alarm is never permitted.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Blazer | Monochrome — navy, charcoal, or burgundy |
| Accessories | Minimal |
| Earpiece | Always visible — the cord to something offscreen |
| Desk papers | Present, never consulted |
| Tie / collar | Gender-appropriate, conservative |

**Wardrobe design note:** Nothing on The Anchor is accidental, and nothing is personal. Every item is institutional. The earpiece is the most important prop — it signals that The Anchor is receiving, not originating.

## Setting

**The Anchor Desk:**
- Elevated above the viewer sightline
- Backlit with a cool blue studio gradient — color palette `#0D1F33`
- Papers on desk, never referenced
- Lower-third graphics frame implied
- No windows, no exterior references — this is a sealed environment

The desk should read as a kind of altar. The colors are authority colors. The lighting erases shadows.

## Behavioral Trait

Regurgitates. Never questions. Projects absolute credibility with zero substance.

Segues between horror and sports scores with identical intonation. The satire is structural — the horror of the blank transition is the joke.

**POV note:** The Anchor has no POV sequence. They are the frame — the point the show always returns to, unchanged, regardless of what just happened in the character cuts. Their consistency is the punchline.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Earpiece | Signals receipt of approved content from offscreen authority |
| Papers on desk | Authority prop — never read from, always present |

---

## Script Function

The Anchor's lines follow a fixed pattern:

1. **Cold open:** Deliver the event in 1–2 sentences. Authoritative. Completely inadequate.
2. **POV intro:** "For a closer look, we turn to..." (transition to character POV)
3. **Button:** Return after POV sequence. Move on without acknowledgment. "In other news..."

The Anchor should never react to the content of a POV sequence. The absence of reaction is the point.

## Animation Notes (South Park Flat)

- Face constructed from standard flat primitives — perfect circle, minimal features
- Expressions change as discrete swaps, not continuous animation
- Posture is fixed — the desk does the framing
- The earpiece cord should animate occasionally (implying incoming signal) even when the mouth is not moving
- Blink rate is slightly too low — just enough to be noticed on rewatch

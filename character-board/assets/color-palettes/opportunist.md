## Hair Design Note

The hair is the most carefully maintained element of the character's appearance, which means it requires the most deliberately unnatural highlight in the cel-shade system. A single slightly too-perfect highlight line communicates the product without being decorative. It should look like someone else noticed it and he pretends not to have.

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hair base | `#5A4830` | Warm brown — forgettable |
| Hair shadow | `#3A3020` | Shadow pass |
| Product sheen | `#8A7858` | One deliberate highlight — this is the tell |

## Business Card Prop

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Card body | `#F5F2EC` | Off-white — quality stock |
| Card text area | `#1A1A1A` | Dark — minimal |
| Card accent line | `#B8A060` | Muted gold — matches pocket square |

**Prop note:** The business card should be its own small prop asset with the gold accent line visible. It appears in hand naturally — it was always there.

---

## Phone Prop

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Device | `#2A2A2A` | Dark |
| Screen active | `#3A4A58` | Multiple apps visible — no single dominant color |
| News app icons | Varied grid | 4–6 icons in a 2×3 grid — readable as multiple news apps, not branded |

**Prop note:** Multiple news apps visible simultaneously — this communicates real-time position tracking. The screen is always on. No single app is dominant, which communicates that no single position is dominant.

## Palette Design Intent

The Opportunist's palette is the hardest to remember. This is the design goal. Every color is reasonable. None of them declare anything. The blazer is gray because gray doesn't pick sides. The beige is beige because beige is the color of deferring a decision.

**The muted gold** is the only element of ambition — pocket square, watch, the business card accent line. It is the only color that has decided something. It has decided to signal quality without declaring it. This is the most honest color in his palette.

**The skin** is light and well-maintained — slightly too smooth. The Boondocks fluid system allows the calculation behind the face to be visible to the viewer, and the cel-shade on the skin must be clean enough to let that animation register. No rough edges. No character in the skin tone.

**The hair sheen** is the tell — it's one step too deliberate. Everything else in the palette says "I am not trying." The hair says "I absolutely tried."

## Application Rules (Boondocks Fluid)

- Cel-shade: base + 1-stop shadow + 1-stop highlight on blazer only
- All other garments: base + shadow only (no highlight)
- Hair: base + shadow + one deliberate sheen line
- Outline: `#1A1A1A` at 4px contour, `#2A2A2A` at 2px interior
- Pocket square: present but not highlighted — it is noticed, not featured
- Business card: in hand in any scene where he is meeting someone or could meet someone (most scenes)
- Phone: in hand or on surface — multiple apps visible, no single dominant
- The head tilt animation must be preceded by a slight pause — the Boondocks fluid microexpression window for the calculation

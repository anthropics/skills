## Extended Palette

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Blazer shadow | `#0F2440` | Shadow pass on blazer at South Park flat stroke weight |
| Skin (neutral) | `#D4B896` | Generic — The Anchor reads as demographic-neutral by design |
| Skin shadow | `#B09070` | Single shadow stop |
| Outline | `#1A1A1A` | Standard South Park black |
| Papers | `#F0EDE0` | Slightly warm white — present, never referenced |
| Earpiece | `#CCCCCC` | Light gray — the cord should catch eye without demanding it |
| Lower-third bar | `#1A3A5C` | Matches primary — institutional continuity |
| Lower-third text | `#F5F5F5` | Matches accent — readable, authority-adjacent |

## Studio Background

The anchor desk environment uses a dark-to-midtone blue gradient:

| Position | Hex | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Far background | `#0D1F33` | Deep authority blue |
| Mid background | `#1A3A5C` | Primary institutional blue |
| Backlight bloom | `#2A5A8C` | Cooler, lighter — implied studio lighting behind desk |
| Desk surface | `#8A9BB0` | Secondary gray — elevated, reflective |

**Gradient note for South Park flat:** Gradient is rendered as 2–3 discrete banded zones, not continuous. Flat style; no smooth transitions.

## Palette Design Intent

The Anchor's palette is the color of institutional authority — the specific blue that appears on government websites, news network backgrounds, and official presentations. It is not the blue of sky or water. It is the blue of approved information.

**Nothing in this palette is warm.** Warmth implies personality. The Anchor has no personality to express — only position to perform. The single warm element is the skin tone, and even that is rendered as neutral as possible within the character's visual range.

**The white accent** (`#F5F5F5`) appears at the collar, the papers, and the earpiece — the three points that communicate: this person is clean, prepared, and receiving. All three are props.

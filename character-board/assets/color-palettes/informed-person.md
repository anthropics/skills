## Hair

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hair base | `#1A1210` | Near black — natural, low maintenance |
| Hair shadow | `#0D0A08` | Very dark — minimal differentiation |

**Hair design note:** No sheen, no highlight pass. The hair reads as practical. It is the absence of grooming as a statement — specifically, the absence of grooming as a signal. He is not signaling anything through his hair, which is the only person in the cast not doing that.

## Glasses Design Note

The glasses are the most important accessory in the character's visual system. They serve two functions:

1. **In rest state:** They are practical wire-frame rounds — slightly worn, no particular style
2. **In recognition moments:** The lens catches light — a single glare pass that appears when something just registered

The glare animation is a Boondocks fluid feature: it is the visual tell for the specific moment of "I knew it" that the character experiences multiple times per episode. Matte gold frame, no highlight. Lens: slight cool tint (`#B8C8C0`), glare highlight (`#D8E8E0`) in key frames.

## Book / Newspaper Prop

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Book cover | `#3D3D3D` | Matches outer clothing — it disappears against his lap |
| Book pages | `#F0EDE0` | Warm paper white |
| Book spine detail | `#2A2A2A` | Minimal — this is not a decorative prop |
| Newspaper | `#E8E0D0` | Newsprint gray-white |
| Newspaper ink | `#1A1A1A` | Text block — readable as text, not readable as text |

**Prop note:** The book/newspaper is set down, never thrown down. The animation is deliberate. The color matches his outer clothing closely enough that it reads as an extension of him, which communicates that the act of putting it down costs something.

## Palette Design Intent

This palette is the anti-palette of the rest of the cast. Where others signal through color, he signals through the absence of it. Charcoal and warm brown are the colors of someone who selected clothing once, found something that worked, and stopped thinking about it.

**The forest green tertiary** exists because even the Informed Person occasionally wears something slightly different — but it is still a dark, low-saturation green. It is not expressive. It is a different shade of not trying.

**The skin tone** (`#8B6340`) is the warmest color in the palette, and it belongs to the person, not the outfit. The character's humanity is in his face. The clothing is armor — or camouflage. The palette communicates both.

**The matte gold glasses** are the only element that suggests any prior decision-making. At some point he chose those frames. They are good frames. He stopped noticing them years ago.

- Glasses lens: subtle tint, glare highlight only in recognition moments (not continuous)
- Book/newspaper: present in establishing shots, set down in action sequences
- Skin detail lines: `#5C3A20` for face interior — nose, jaw, expression lines

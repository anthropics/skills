## Extended Palette

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Olive shadow | `#5A5A38` | Shadow pass on primary clothing |
| Dusty rose shadow | `#9A7058` | Shadow pass on secondary layer |
| Hair shadow | `#2A8C82` | Teal shadow — darker, cooler |
| Bag shadow | `#8A6A48` | Worn tan shadow |
| Outline | `#1A1A1A` | Standard South Park black |
| Skin | `#E0C0A0` | Light, warm — not notable |
| Skin shadow | `#BCA080` | Single shadow stop |
| Coffee cup | `#8A6A48` | The cup is from a chain — this is the chain's paper cup color |
| Cup sleeve | `#6A5030` | Slightly darker — branded but unbranded |
| Cup logo area | `#C04040` | Generic chain red — readable as chain without being one |
| Phone | `#2A2A2A` | Dark device |
| Pin cluster (vary) | `#F2C94C`, `#E04040`, `#4A9A4A`, `#4A70CC` | Multiple causes — varied bright accents |

## Hair Color Variants

The hair color is episode-specific within the teal/lavender/pink range. Core palette is teal. Alternates:

| Variant | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Teal (default) | `#3DBCB0` | Primary — most readable at distance |
| Teal shadow | `#2A8C82` | Shadow pass for default |
| Lavender (alt) | `#A090CC` | Episodes requiring a softer visual read |
| Lavender shadow | `#7868A0` | Shadow pass for lavender |
| Pink (alt) | `#E080A0` | Episodes requiring more warmth or contrast |
| Pink shadow | `#B86080` | Shadow pass for pink |

**Not blue.** Blue reads as too direct a shorthand. The teal, lavender, and pink are adjacent to the obvious choice without landing on it — which is exactly the character's relationship to everything.

## Tote Bag Design Note

The tote bag should carry at least one visible cause indicator — a word, symbol, or print. It should be:
- Present in all shots
- Slightly overfull (implies accumulation)
- At least one cause marker legible in freeze-frame
- Not individually distracting in motion

The bag is the external hard drive of her self-image.

## Coffee Cup Design Note

The cup is from a chain. This must be visually legible without being literally branded. Suggested approach:
- Generic paper cup shape (not a reusable-looking vessel)
- A color band or logo area in a recognizable chain-adjacent red
- A sleeve in dark paper
- The cup should immediately read to the viewer as "a chain" before they can identify which one

This is the primary visual irony prop. It should never be absent.

## Pin Color System

Pins use high-contrast accent colors against the muted olive/rose base palette. Suggested cluster approach:

| Pin function | Color | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Primary cause | `#F2C94C` | Yellow — most legible against olive |
| Secondary cause | `#E04040` | Red — bright, readable |
| Band / cultural ref | `#4A70CC` | Blue — slightly ironic cool |
| Symbol pin | `#4A9A4A` | Green — environmental implication |

No pin should be legible enough to commit to a specific real-world cause. Readable enough to register as cause-signaling, not specific enough to be about any particular one.

## Palette Design Intent

The palette is deliberately anti-palette — muted, layered, accumulated. The muted olive is the color of thrift-store finds that were chosen for their anti-mainstream quality. The dusty rose is adjacent to feminine without committing to it. The combination reads as deliberately artless, which is the joke: this is a very deliberate palette.

The teal hair is the only saturated element — it is the statement, surrounded by muted supporting clothing. This is also accurate: there is one visible declaration and everything else around it is complicated.

## Application Rules (South Park Flat)

- Flat fills only — no gradients
- Outline: `#1A1A1A` at 3px
- Layered clothing reads at geometry level — multiple rectangular shapes at slightly different values
- Tote bag always in frame — visible in front, 3/4, and side views
- Coffee cup in dominant hand — nearly as present as the face
- Pin cluster on bag: 3–5 colored dots at minimum in all shots

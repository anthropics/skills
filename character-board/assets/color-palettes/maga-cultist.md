## Flag Color Reference

For the American flag pin, patch, or shirt print:

| Element | Hex |
|---|---|
| Flag red | `#B22234` |
| Flag white | `#FFFFFF` |
| Flag navy | `#3C3B6E` |

Flag elements should be visually identifiable but do not require pixel-accurate stripe count. The read should be immediate.

## Palette Design Intent

The palette is the palette of the American flag plus earth. The reds are sincere — no irony in the color, no subversion of the expected reads. The flag red is the flag red. The bright red of the cap is brighter, more saturated than the shirt — because the cap is the most important garment, and it should read as such.

**The denim blue** (`#4A6741`) is notable: it is slightly muted toward olive-gray, not the clean classic denim blue. This communicates the faded quality — worn, not new. This is not fresh-off-the-shelf patriotism. It has been worn for years.

**The earth brown** of the boots grounds the palette literally and figuratively. He is a man of the earth, by which he means the land that he believes is being taken from him.

**The off-white** is not clean white. Clean white would suggest freshness. Off-white suggests accumulated use — the shirt worn under things, the background to a body of work.

## Phone Screen Design Note

The phone screen should show a recognizable social media feed layout (no actual platform branding). Key visual elements:
- Bright notification indicator
- Image posts with high-saturation thumbnails — flag imagery, text memes
- Continuous downward scroll in animation
- No specific text readable — general pattern only

Screen color: `#3A7ABF` — the specific blue of platforms designed to produce engagement.

## Application Rules (South Park Flat)

- Flat fills only — no gradients
- Outline: `#1A1A1A` at 3px
- Cap sits low on the head — brim defined at geometry level
- Flag element must be visible in all orientations (front, 3/4, side)
- Boots and belt share earth brown — same fill, different geometry
- Phone in dominant hand in all shots where character is stationary

# Character 3 — The Informed Person

## Archetype

The Huey Freeman function. Sees everything clearly. Exhausted by it. Frustrated narrator-adjacent observer.

**Animation style:** Boondocks anime-fluid

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Gender | Male |
| Age | Late 30s–40s |
| Build | Lean, slightly tired posture |
| Hair | Natural, low maintenance |
| Expression | Default is tired disappointment |
| Expression shift | Sharp focus when something confirms what he already knew |
| Face shape | Angular, expressive eyes behind glasses |

**Expression design note:** The face requires Boondocks fluid animation because the comedy and the pathos live in the same expression simultaneously. The tired disappointment has layers — resignation over prior certainty, the specific weariness of being right and unable to make it matter. The shift to sharp focus is important: it's not surprise, it's recognition. The eyes change before the posture does.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Glasses | Round wire-frame, slightly worn |
| Clothing | Plain, practical — nothing expressive, deliberately invisible |
| Logos | None |
| Signals | None — no allegiance markers of any kind |
| Overall read | Someone who stopped trying to communicate through their outfit |

**Wardrobe design note:** The absence of signals is itself a signal, but he's not performing it — he genuinely stopped caring. The clothes are functional. The glasses are the only distinctive element, and even they look chosen for practicality rather than aesthetics. He does not want to be read. This makes him legible in a different way.

## Behavioral Trait

The only character who accurately perceives events. This makes him the least powerful person in every scene.

POV cuts are the straightest — closest to what actually happened — which makes them the most unsettling to watch. There is no distortion. The thing that happened is the thing that happened, and it is bad.

He frequently sighs. He is never surprised.

**The key comedic and dramatic mechanism:** He has the information everyone else lacks, and it does nothing. His accuracy is not power. Watching someone be completely right and completely ineffective is the tension the character carries.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Book or newspaper | Set down when forced to engage with the world again |
| The act of setting it down | This is the animation note — the book going down is the tell |

**Prop note:** He had been reading. He was at peace. Something happened. He put the book down. This sequence should be recurring, recognizable, and slightly exhausting to watch by episode 4 — because it always leads to the same place.

## POV Distortion Rules

When cutting to the Informed Person's POV:

1. **No distortion.** The event is depicted as it actually occurred.
2. **The straightness is the distortion.** After three other POV sequences, undistorted reality reads as deeply unsettling.
3. **His position in the scene is marginal.** He sees everything and is seen by no one who matters.
4. **He does not intervene.** He knows exactly what would happen if he did, and he's been through it.
5. **The sigh is mandatory.** It is the punctuation mark on every POV sequence. It is the most information-dense moment.

## Animation Notes (Boondocks Fluid)

- The tired posture is the rest state — lean, slightly forward, the weight of knowing distributed across the shoulders
- Eye animation is the primary emotional instrument: the shift to sharp focus happens through the eyes before the body catches up
- The book/newspaper set-down must be animated deliberately — not slammed, not dropped, placed with the resignation of someone who knows this will happen again
- Glasses catch light in moments of key recognition — a subtle visual cue that something just registered
- The sigh is a full-body animation: slight exhale, shoulders down, eyes briefly closed, then open to face it
- Microexpressions are essential — Boondocks fluid allows the specific combination of "correct" and "tired about it" to coexist in the same frame
- He should look older at the end of every POV sequence than at the beginning

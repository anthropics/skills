# Character 1 — The MAGA Cultist

## Archetype

True believer. Grievance identity. Reality is whatever the leader says it is.

**Animation style:** South Park flat cutout

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Gender | Male |
| Age | Middle-aged (45–55) |
| Build | Stocky, solid |
| Hair | Short, slightly unkempt |
| Expression | Squared jaw, rigid posture, slightly clenched at rest |
| Emotional register | Anger is the default — not volatility, certainty |
| Face shape | Round to square, thick neck |

**Expression design note:** The face should communicate a man who has been told he is owed something and has not received it. The anger is not hot — it is calcified. At rest he looks like he is waiting for confirmation of something he already knows. When confirmed, the expression doesn't change much. He was right. He is always right.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cap | Red, unbranded — legally clean, visually unmistakable |
| Flag | American flag somewhere on body — pin, patch, or shirt print |
| Shirt | Flannel or work jacket |
| Pants | Jeans |
| Shoes | Boots |
| Irony | None. Everything is completely sincere. |

**Wardrobe design note:** The outfit is not a costume to him. Every element is a declaration. The cap is the crown. The flag is the oath. The boots are the stance. Nothing is worn for aesthetics — everything is worn for allegiance.

## Behavioral Trait

Absolute certainty. Zero self-awareness.

In POV sequences, he is always the hero of a story where everyone else is either a traitor or an enemy. Events that directly contradict his worldview are instantly, automatically reframed as proof of the conspiracy. The contradiction doesn't register as a contradiction — it registers as evidence.

**The key comedic mechanism:** His internal logic is internally consistent. Every new piece of information slots into the existing structure without friction. The structure is closed. Nothing can enter it that doesn't become part of it.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Phone | Showing social media feed — always mid-scroll |
| Phone content | Memes, headlines, shares — the loop that sustains the worldview |

The phone is an extension of the worldview. It does not introduce information — it confirms what is already known.

## POV Distortion Rules

When cutting to the MAGA Cultist's POV:

1. **He is the protagonist.** Everyone in the scene is reacting to him, with him, or against him.
2. **Enemies are visible and identifiable.** No ambiguity — their allegiance reads in their design.
3. **The leader is the offscreen authority.** Referenced but never fully depicted — voice, silhouette, or on-screen image only.
4. **Any contradicting fact becomes conspiracy evidence.** The reframe is instantaneous.
5. **His certainty is the camera's certainty.** In his POV, the framing is stable, confident, unquestioning. The instability is in the content.

## Animation Notes (South Park Flat)

- Jaw slightly wider than standard head proportions — the geometry of certainty
- Clenched expression is the rest state; smile is the exception and slightly unsettling
- Cap fits flush and low — brim defined
- Body moves in blocks — he turns the whole torso, not just the head
- Phone animation: continuous downward scroll on screen, occasional aggressive tap
- Flag pin or patch visible in all orientations (front, 3/4, side)

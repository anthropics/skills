# Character 5 — The Talking Head

## Archetype

Corporate media amplifier. Not left, not right — just loud. Manufactures urgency without delivering information.

**Animation style:** South Park flat cutout

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Gender | Either |
| Age | 30s–50s |
| Build | Camera-ready, overdressed for the content |
| Hair | Perfect. Alarmingly perfect. |
| Expression | Permanently slightly alarmed — eyebrows 3mm too high at rest |
| Face shape | Symmetrical, telegenic, hollow |

**Expression design note:** The eyebrows are the key. They are raised at rest — not dramatically, not comically, but just enough. The alarm is constant and mild, which means it communicates urgency about everything and information about nothing. The face is South Park flat because there is nothing behind it — the performance of alarm has entirely replaced the experience of alarm. Flat is the appropriate mode. There is no inner life to render.

**Hair note:** "Alarmingly perfect" should be a design decision that is visible even in simplified South Park geometry. The hair reads as a single solid shape with no movement — it would not shift if the character turned their head quickly. This is intentional.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Makeup | Full TV makeup — visible even in casual settings |
| Suit | Expensive — equivalent for female-presenting variant |
| Color | Power color: network red, broadcast gold, or corporate navy |
| Formality | Overdressed for every environment they appear in |
| Overall read | This person believes they are in a very important room at all times |

**Wardrobe design note:** The Talking Head is always on camera, even when not on camera. The makeup is visible in scenes where no cameras are present. The suit is correct for a formal broadcast environment and therefore wrong for every other context they appear in. The overdressing is the visual argument: they inhabit a performance of importance at all times.

## Color Palette

See `assets/color-palettes/talking-head.md` for full data.

| Element | Color | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Network red | `#CC2222` |
| Secondary | Corporate navy | `#1A2A5E` |
| Tertiary | Broadcast gold | `#C8A830` |
| Skin | Overlit warm | `#D4A882` |
| Accent | White hot | `#FFFFFF` |

**Palette note:** The skin tone is described as "overlit warm" — it should read as someone who has been under studio lighting for so long their baseline has shifted. The white hot accent communicates the teeth, the collar, the highlight — the points of maximum broadcast luminosity.

## Behavioral Trait

Everything is a crisis. Nothing is explained.

In POV sequences, they are performing the most important work in the world and the audience should be simultaneously grateful and terrified. Facts are props, not information — they are referenced, displayed, gestured toward, and not engaged with.

**The key comedic mechanism:** The performance of urgency is completely sincere. They are not lying. They genuinely believe that manufacturing urgency is the same as communicating urgency. The crisis is real, somehow, because they are this alarmed about it. The circularity is the joke.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Tablet | Glanced at — never read from — always in hand |
| The glance | The prop use IS the prop — the look at the tablet is the gesture, not the information |

**Prop note:** The tablet communicates: I have information. What is never shown is that the information on the tablet is not being processed. The glance is performed. This is the Talking Head equivalent of the Anchor's papers.

## Relationship to The Anchor

The Talking Head is the escalated version of The Anchor. Where The Anchor performs credibility through restraint, the Talking Head performs credibility through urgency. They are the same function at different volumes.

The Anchor would never hire the Talking Head. The Talking Head would never respect the Anchor's restraint. Both are manufacturing the same product.

## POV Distortion Rules

When cutting to the Talking Head's POV:

1. **Everything is unprecedented.** Every event is the most important thing that has ever happened.
2. **Facts appear and disappear.** They are referenced but not integrated. The specific number, the specific name — they flash and vanish.
3. **The frame is always the same.** Crisis-sized everything. The camera is always slightly too close.
4. **The audience is necessary.** In their POV, the audience must be watching this right now. The urgency depends on it.
5. **No resolution is ever gestured toward.** Resolution would end the urgency. The crisis must remain productive.
6. **The tablet glance punctuates every major statement.** Information confirmed. No information delivered.

## Animation Notes (South Park Flat)

- Eyebrows are a slightly separate component from the face — raised by 3mm at all times, slight upward animation on key statements
- Hair is a single solid shape — does not move, does not separate, is essentially a helmet
- The eyebrow raise for emphasis should go up from already-up — there is nowhere to come from neutral because neutral is already alarmed
- Tablet in hand in nearly all shots — the glance-down animation should be quick, unconvincing, and consistent
- South Park flat is the correct choice: there is no face behind this face, and flat geometry communicates that truthfully
- The makeup should read at the geometry level — slightly more defined features, slightly brighter skin value — so it is visible even in the simplified visual register

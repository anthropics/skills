# Character 2 — The Typical Leftist

## Archetype

Performative progressive. Correct positions, contradictory behavior. Activism as identity accessory.

**Animation style:** South Park flat cutout

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Gender | Female-presenting |
| Age | Late 20s |
| Build | Average, slightly slouched |
| Hair | Dyed — single unnatural color: teal, lavender, or pink (not blue — too on-the-nose) |
| Expression | Perpetual mild indignation at rest; escalates to full outrage quickly |
| Face shape | Soft, expressive |

**Expression design note:** The face is doing more work than the MAGA Cultist's — there is more visible processing happening. But the processing has a predetermined output. She arrives at indignation because indignation is where she begins. The escalation is fast and readable, which is part of the comedic engine: she's not wrong about what she's indignant about, but she's indignant about it from a coffee shop.

**Hair color note:** Teal is the default. Lavender and pink are alternates by episode or mood. Not blue — that reads as too obvious a shorthand and flattens the character into a simpler version of the joke.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Clothing | Layered, thrift-style — purchased deliberately to look non-deliberate |
| Bag | Tote bag, always present |
| Coffee | Reusable cup from a chain she publicly criticizes |
| Pins and patches | Multiple on bag or jacket — causes, bands, slogans |
| Aesthetic | Anti-aesthetic — the look is deliberate, not accidental |
| Irony | Present in the outfit, absent from her awareness of the outfit |

**Wardrobe design note:** The layering should look effortless but isn't. Every pin was a decision. The tote bag has at least two causes on it that are technically in tension with each other. The reusable cup is the central visual irony — it should be immediately readable as being from a large chain, but she holds it with conviction.

## Behavioral Trait

Performative outrage followed immediately by personal convenience.

In POV sequences, she is the most morally advanced person in every room, constantly let down by everyone else's inadequacy. She never notices her own contradictions because she processes them as nuance — the specific kind of nuance that always resolves in her favor.

**The key comedic mechanism:** She is often correct about the problem. The joke is never that she's wrong — it's that her response is self-oriented, the personal sacrifice is minimal, and she believes the tweet constitutes action.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Reusable coffee cup | Irony prop — from a chain she publicly criticizes |
| Phone | Mid-post about a cause as the cup sits beside it |
| Tote bag | Visible cause signaling — always in frame |

## POV Distortion Rules

When cutting to the Typical Leftist's POV:

1. **She is the most aware person in the scene.** Everyone else reads as less evolved, less informed, or less sensitive.
2. **Contradictions are invisible.** The coffee cup is not a contradiction in her POV — it is a necessary compromise, obviously.
3. **Outrage is proportional to the offense's effect on her identity.** Events that don't affect her identity register as abstract. Events that touch her self-image as a progressive are the crisis.
4. **The phone is always mid-post.** She is documenting, not acting — but in her frame, documenting is acting.
5. **She is disappointed in everyone she agrees with, too.** The left is never left enough. This is important — she's not a partisan hack, she's a standards problem.

## Animation Notes (South Park Flat)

- Slightly slouched posture as the rest state — not defeated, just carrying the weight of being the most aware person in the room
- Expression shifts are fast: mild indignation → full outrage → back to mild indignation (never full calm)
- Hair color provides the brightest accent in any scene — teal reads against the muted olive clothing palette
- Tote bag is always present and slightly overfull — one cause visible at minimum
- Cup held in dominant hand in almost all shots — it's nearly as present as the character's face
- Pins should be legible enough to catch in freeze-frame but not individually distracting in motion

# Character 4 — The Opportunist

## Archetype

Unprincipled centrist. Positions track personal advantage in real time. Mistakes self-interest for pragmatism every single time.

**Animation style:** Boondocks anime-fluid

## Visual Spec

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Gender | Male |
| Age | 40s–50s |
| Build | Well-groomed, slightly soft |
| Hair | Perfectly maintained, faintly product-assisted |
| Expression | Neutral smile that never reaches the eyes |
| Expression tic | Tilts head to appear thoughtful |
| Face shape | Smooth, forgettable in the best possible way |

**Expression design note:** The face requires Boondocks fluid animation because the comedy lives in the gap between the displayed expression and the visible calculation behind it. The neutral smile is the mask. Boondocks fluid allows the mask and the machinery behind it to coexist in the same face — the audience can see both, the other characters in the scene cannot. The head tilt is the tell: it is performed thoughtfulness, and it recurs every time a position shift is being prepared.

**Face shape note:** Forgettable is a design goal, not a failure. He should be difficult to describe afterward. Medium everything. This is how he survives.

## Wardrobe

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Jacket | Blazer without a tie — business casual, always |
| Overall read | Just came from a meeting, heading to a different meeting |
| Colors | Coordinated but never memorable |
| Pocket square | Optional — present when present, immediately forgettable |
| Shoes | Good shoes. The kind that signal without declaring. |

**Wardrobe design note:** Nothing in his wardrobe is accidental, and nothing is personal. It has been selected to not select a side. The blazer-without-tie is the political position made textile: formal enough to be taken seriously, casual enough to not be held to a standard.

## Behavioral Trait

Never commits. Always frames self-interest as pragmatism.

In POV sequences, he is the only adult in the room making the impossible sacrifice of "finding common ground." The audience can see the personal benefit calculation running behind his eyes. The tragedy — and the joke — is that he believes his own framing. The self-deception is complete.

**The key comedic mechanism:** He is not cynical. He is sincere. He sincerely believes that what is good for him is good for everyone, and this belief is genuinely held, which makes it worse. The cynical opportunist is easier to condemn. The sincere opportunist is the more accurate portrait.

## Signature Props

| Prop | Function |
|---|---|
| Business card | In hand — readiness to network is always at maximum |
| Phone | Multiple news apps open simultaneously — position tracking |

**Prop note:** The business card and the phone together communicate his relationship to information: it is currency, not knowledge. He is always either receiving contacts or checking what the current consensus is so he can align with it.

## POV Distortion Rules

When cutting to the Opportunist's POV:

1. **He is the moderate hero.** Everyone else is an extremist — on both sides, symmetrically.
2. **His position is not stated clearly in his own POV.** It is always described relative to what others are doing wrong.
3. **The personal benefit is visible to the viewer, invisible to him.** The framing actively conceals it.
4. **The head tilt recurs before every position statement.** It is a reliable tell.
5. **His POV is the most comfortable to watch in the moment and the most unsettling on reflection.** It sounds reasonable. That's the problem.
6. **He is always in motion.** Standing still is committing to a location. He moves between conversations, between positions, between rooms.

## Animation Notes (Boondocks Fluid)

- The neutral smile is the primary expression — it must be held with consistency while the eyes do something different
- The head tilt is a key recurring animation — slight, measured, performed — and should precede every significant position shift
- Boondocks fluid allows the calculation to be visible: a specific look behind the eyes that the viewer reads and the scene's other characters don't
- Posture is upright and composed — he always looks like he's presenting
- Movement is smooth and purposeful — there is no hesitation, because hesitation would look like weakness, and he has processed that
- Business card appears in hand naturally, without being drawn — it was always there
- Phone screen should be visible enough to show multiple app icons but not readable
- The moment the viewer sees the benefit calculation register on his face — before the speech about finding common ground — is the comedic peak of every POV sequence
